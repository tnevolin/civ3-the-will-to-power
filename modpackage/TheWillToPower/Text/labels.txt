Get me a new team!
Maybe YOU could be on their team next time?
How would YOU have liked being locked in an alliance with these guys?!
No - seriously - I was supposed to have been on the OTHER team.
Nothing like being locked to a LOSER!
WE are the champions.
What a GREAT alliance!
You are the leader that this alliance always needed.
Something's under my foot. Wait, it's the other team!
With this alliance, we can win ANYthing!
Go back to chieftain!
Don't worry "champ," you'll get 'em next time. 
You look so lovely when you lose.
We crushed you, saw you driven before us, and hear the lamentation of your people!
Consider your lawn MOWED!
All you're leading is Jack and spit.  Jack just left town.
All your base are belong to us!
Gimme an 'L!'  Gimme an 'O!' Whatever... LOSER!
Told!
Aww... was that your last city?  Maybe we should give it back...
There's no shame in retiring... none at all... really... no, really...
If in times of trouble, you run into a wall... bounce off, and run back into it.
What's that smell?  Did someone step in something?
You will be forever remembered as a great and noble... well, I guess not...
If you practice a little more, I might break a sweat next time.
What's the matter?  Are we too rough?
Hey speed demon!  Where're you running off to in such a hurry?
Yeah, you'd better run away!
Only human...
One day, there will come a player unafraid to battle it out to the bitter end...
Luck, it was all luck!
There is no dishonor in losing to a worthy foe... I should be ashamed.
Congratu - ma - freaking - lations!
Every dog has his day, I guess...
Oh yeah?  You and what army?  Oh... right.
Next time, I'll play [without] one arm tied behind my back.
What! I couldn't have possibly lost... you must have cheated!
Quit gloating, let's go again!
I bet you 100 gold that you can't do it again!
Two words:  Wait 'til next time!
You're the big dog now!
What a splendid display of tact and strategy!
A plate of hero cookies to you!
You played very well, but I will not be so lenient next time.
Our bards will write ballads of your deeds and accomplishments.
Esteemed colleague, I congratulate you on your victory.
Who's the big winner today?  You are!  That's right, you!
It was an honor to play against so fine an opponent.
It seems the fates favor you today.  'Twas a good game.  I'll be waiting for the next one.
Wow!  I was fabulous!  Amazing!  Phenomenal!  Fantastic!  Outstanding!  Exceptional!   And still you won...
I got trounced, and all these other clowns just watched...
Have you no mercy?  I was already defeated, there was no need to eliminate me.
Now let me ask ya this,  let me ask ya this... Can you kick... oh, I guess so.
My doctor says I can play you again in 60 seconds or so... Beware!
Well, I can't be blamed.  I never even met you!
You'd best feel lucky that the world was so concentrated on taking me out that they forgot about you...
Real warriors don't need allies to win!
I thought cultural assimilation was supposed to be painless!
Doh!  I thought we were [supposed] to kick your people off the planet...
All right, now step over [this] line...
What do you mean the game's over???  I'm still standing!  No one can conquer me!
Domination, shmomination!  I refuse to be defeated!
You wasted your time killing me off, and look what it got you.
Together we could have survived the onslaught.  We could have thrived.
You should have saved me.  I would have voted for you!
He who stands alone in the international community loses.
All the armies in the world cannot help the uncultured.
The pen may be mightier than the sword, but my sword is longer than your pen is.
I'm sorry, were you out of cities?   My bad...
Owned!
Sure you can kill me off, but when the going gets tough, look who gets going!
A real tough one here... fight's the good fight when he's stronger, but bails out at the first sign of trouble.
Would that I could have run away a spineless coward, rather than face the steel of my enemies.
Close the door on your way out.

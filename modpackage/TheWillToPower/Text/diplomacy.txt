"I am $AI4, of the Mighty $CIVADJ7. I see that your primitive civilization lacks much knowledge and wisdom. Agree to this exchange and let us thrive together."

"Hail, friend! $CIVNAME6 has need of your assistance! Please give us $GET3, so that our friendship will continue."
"$PLAYER0, you must face the facts: $CIVNAME6 is your superior, and you would do well to pay us homage. Give us $GET3."
"That certainly is a nice little civilization you have there, $PLAYER0. It would be unfortunate if something were to happen to it..."
"Ah, $PLAYER0. I have an excellent deal to offer you: give us what we want, and we will not crush you. Does that not sound fair?"
"The superior $CIVADJ7 civilization is worthy of tribute. Dispense goods to us, and we'll refrain from sending our $UNIT4 to crush you."
"Think well, $PLAYER0: if you give us tribute, our friendship will continue. If not, we will have to seriously re-evaluate our relationship."
"$CIVADJ7 culture is the envy of the world. We hope that you'll make a small contribution to ensure its continued ascendancy..."
"Conventional $CIVADJ7 wisdom suggests that you bequeath certain goods to us or be destroyed."
"$PLAYER0, give us $GET3 or suffer the consequences!"
"$CIVNAME6 demands that you pay tribute. It is for your own good."
"$PLAYER0, would you like to volunteer a small donation to the cause of world peace?"
"$CIVNAME6 requires tribute from inferior cultures such as yours. Comply or be destroyed."
"The $CIVADJ7 Folk have put up with your insults long enough! Pay us the following or suffer the consequences!"
"Do not let foolish pride cause the downfall of your people, $PLAYER0. Pay us what we want - or be destroyed!"
"Mighty $CIVNAME6 demands that you acknowledge her superiority with this small token of respect!"
"Mother $CIVNAME6 requires from you a token of friendship. Or would you prefer that we wipe $CIVNAME1 from the face of the planet?"
"If you wish your pathetic civilization to survive, $PLAYER0, you had better comply with our demands!"
"I wonder if you would consider giving us a small gift, $PLAYER0, in honor of the timeless friendship between Mighty $CIVNAME6 and your weak and defenseless people?"
"As the tree raises its branches to honor the clouds, so must YOU show respect to those above you. Pay us tribute or risk our displeasure."
"It is said that when one meets a hungry tiger, one should give it a meal or risk becoming a meal. $CIVNAME6 awaits your tribute, $PLAYER0."
"A wise man is one who knows who to bully - and who to grovel to. It is time for us to clarify OUR relationship, $PLAYER0. Will you pay us our due?"
"$PLAYER0, don't you think it's time that you repaid the generous $CIVADJ7 people with a small gift?"
"$CIVNAME6 is the sole hope for world peace, $PLAYER0. It is time that you rewarded our efforts."
"Don't think of this as a demand for tribute, $PLAYER0. Think of it as an offer for you to invest in world peace."
"Given the many concessions we have granted you previously, is it not time for you to give us something in return?"
"For the sake of friendship, you might want to consider giving us a small gift."
"Agree to our demands, $PLAYER0, or be destroyed."
"Would you care to take part in our share-the-wealth program, $PLAYER0?"
"The honor of $CIVNAME6 requires that we ask you to give us a small donation."
"$CIVNAME6 demands that you give us the following tribute. Our $UNIT4 await your response."
"Peace and brotherhood requires sacrifice, $PLAYER0. From you."
"Furnish $CIVNAME6 with these gifts and we will tolerate your existence for a little while longer."
"Know that $CIVNAME6 stands by $CIVNAME1's side, as wise friend and strong protector. Now - about our fee..."
"Know that $CIVNAME6 is ever-merciful to those who exhibit the proper amount of respect to her. I recommend a paltry gift of, say, $GET3."
"A small gift - say, $GET3 - to mighty $AI5 will ensure your puny civilization's survival."
"I am offering you a one-time only deal, $PLAYER0. Give us what we want and we will not destroy you."
"Weak one! Give us tribute or suffer our wrath!"
"$PLAYER0, the $CIVADJ7 $UNIT4 thirst for your blood. Give us what we want or perish!"
"Do you choose to cravenly lick our boots and give us what we want, or to stand and fight us in a heroic but doomed last stand?"
"Your pathetic civilization relies on the Mighty $CIVADJ8 for protection. It is time that you paid us for this valuable service!"
"Peace with the $CIVADJ8 comes with a price, $PLAYER0. Will you pay?"
"We are bigger and stronger than you, $PLAYER0. You must give us tribute, or suffer the consequences."
"You only exist because the $CIVADJ8 allow it. In return we demand tribute."
"To be honest, raw greed is the only thing stopping us from destroying your puny civilization. Pay us what we want, or perish."
"You exist because the $CIVADJ8 allow you to exist. Pay us tribute!"
"$PLAYER0, I hope you appreciate our forbearance in not destroying you. Do you not think it sensible for you to give us something in return?"
"$PLAYER0, a small gift - say, $GET3 - will ensure your puny civilization's survival."
"Face the facts, $PLAYER0: $CIVNAME6 is your superior. You would do well to pay us tribute. Give us $GET3."
"It is fair that brothers bestow gifts on one another during significant times. Now is such a time for the $CIVADJ8."
"The journey that I, $AI5, have made to visit you is a great honor to the $CIVNAME2 people. Let us mark the occasion with a gift from you to me."
"Time is short and so will be the memory of the $CIVNAME1 should you deny me this token of respect."
"I must insist that you provide me with $GET3 free of charge. This is strictly business, $PLAYER0, nothing personal."
"$PLAYER0, I require $GET3, with no strings attached! Do not concern yourself with what I might gain from this transaction, but rather, what you stand to lose if you refuse me."
"$PLAYER0, I get what I want, and today I want $GET3. Perhaps, some day, you will be in a position to make demands from the other savages, but until then, be glad that I have decided to be gentle about this."
"Hail ye Givers! A guest has come who has need of your fire! What gifts do you set before him?"
"You could not ask for a better burden than a friend in need, $PLAYER0, and this friend needs, $GET3."
"Let no man stint he who has suffered greatly and is in need of wealth, $PLAYER0. Kindly gift me, $GET3, and we shall remain friends."
"While I can not provide the reasons now, our need for $GET3 is severe. Please gift $GET3 to us so that we may continue to be on civil terms."
"Bestow gifts upon your superiors and you are likely to be rewarded a hundred times over. Ignore the advice of wise-men, and you risk being flogged about the head, neck, face, and shoulders."
"For the sake of our continued friendship, provide the great people of $CIVNAME6 with a tribute."
"We demand, $GET3! Place this demand upon your shoulders and make no mention of its burden, $PLAYER0."
"The children of the antlered God loom over your puny nation, $PLAYER0. Offer us the gift of $GET3, and we will spare you, for now!"
"The earth-mother demands that you serve her children, $PLAYER0! Provide us with $GET3 to appease her!"
"Ensure your position among the righteous by freely offering that which you value most. $GET3 is what the $CIVADJ7 people seek. Indulge this minor request, lest they rise against you."
"Provide $GET3 to the $CIVADJ7 people, and they will praise your sacrifice, deny them this and tempt their wrath."
"I require $GET3, but have nothing suitable to offer in return. Instead, I shall submit prayers of peace unto you. Without $GET3, however, I can guarantee no peace."
"My senators have advised me that you have obtained $GET3! Is this true? Hand it over at once, and I will not take it by force."
"$PLAYER0, I understand that you have $GET3. This would surely be an invaluable asset for the $CIVADJ7 people. We demand that you share $GET3 with $CIVNAME6 at once!"
"I see the fate of the $CIVADJ2 people before me, $PLAYER0. Pay tribute to $CIVNAME6, or be flattened under our heel along the path to glory."
"$PLAYER0! You have not been a dutiful friend, tribute this to me now or suffer!"
"Forsake greed, friend! Provide me with a tribute, or tempt the anger of the $CIVADJ7 people."
"Serve the $CIVADJ7 people with this courtesy, or risk angering them."
"In our land it is customary that the meek honor the brave, and so should it be that you honor me, $AI5 of the $CIVADJ7."
"It is a great honor that we meet again. Perhaps you have something small to offer me, $AI5 of the mighty $CIVADJ7, for my troubles in coming to pay you this visit, no?"
"Now would be an opportune time to pay your respects to the powerful $CIVADJ6 civilization by fulfilling this humble request."
"$PLAYER0, grant me $GET3 and I will pray to Kumarbis, the mighty storm god, that he spare the $CIVADJ2 lands from his wrath."
"$PLAYER0, grant the $CIVADJ6 people $GET3 and I will refrain from loosing my brigands of warriors to smite your pitiful people... at least for now."
"Kumarbis has spoken to me, $AI5, great leader of the $CIVADJ8. The storm god insists that now would be a good time for the $CIVADJ2 people to show their friendship by granting $GET3."
"$PLAYER0, leader of noble $CIVNAME1, hear me. It would please me much if you would honor the $CIVADJ7 people with a gift of $GET3."
"$PLAYER0, powerful $CIVNAME6 is in great need of $GET3. Would you please be so kind as to honor us this request?"
"$PLAYER0, I hope that it is not too amiss to expect that, considering your flair for generosity, you will grant the $CIVADJ8 a small gift, such as $GET3."
"$AI5 the Wise, brave leader of $CIVNAME6, hereby demands $GET3. You have only a short time to arrange the details of the transfer - or face his wrath."
"$PLAYER0, it would be most prudent of you to immediately grant $CIVNAME6 $GET3."
"To further the development of $CIVADJ7 culture, your contribution of $GET3 would be most appreciated. That is, unless of course you would rather deal with the fury of $AI5 (a most unwise choice, I assure you)."
"$PLAYER0, if you would like to remain a friend of the $CIVADJ7 people you should give us $GET3."
"There is much joy in giving, $PLAYER0. So that you can experience such pleasure, please give us $GET3."
"Give us $GET3, $PLAYER0, or our armies will give you heck."
“The flame of civilization and learning needs fuel, $PLAYER0.  Give us $GET3 and we will see it put to good use.”
“It is time you were reminded who is the ruler and who is the ruled, $PLAYER0.  Give us $GET3 or the reminder will be less pleasant.”
“Some peoples are best suited to fight, some to explore, some to create works of art… and some, such as $CIVDJ8, are meant to rule the rest. Accordingly, you will give us $GET3, and we will leave you to your own purpose.”
"In our land it is customary that the meek honor the brave, and so should it be that you honor me, $AI5 of the $CIVADJ7."
"It is an honor to the sun god that we meet again. Perhaps you have something small to offer me, $AI5 of the mighty $CIVADJ7, for my troubles in paying you this small visit?"
"Now would be an opportune time to pay your respects to the powerful $CIVADJ6 civilization by fulfilling this god-humbling request."
"$PLAYER0, grant me $GET3 and I will pray to the great jaguar that he spare the $CIVADJ2 lands from his fangs."
"$PLAYER0, grant the $CIVADJ6 people $GET3 and I will keep my javelin throwers from unleashing their wrath upon you and yours…at least for a while."
"The jaguar has spoken to me, $AI5, great ruler of the $CIVADJ8, and he insists that now would be a good time for the $CIVADJ2 people to show their friendship by granting $GET3. The jaguar is always correct."

"Bah. But what else can you expect from a barbarian state like $CIVNAME1? You are not worth exterminating!"
"Well, legally, we would be within our rights to exterminate you, but, uh, we have bigger fish to fry."
"You press your luck, $PLAYER0. You may have gotten away with it this time, but next time you will not be so fortunate."
"I am tempted to show the $CIVNOUN3 the error of their ways. But we will let it pass, for now."
"Ha! So you DO have some backbone! Well done! I was just kidding anyway..."
"Your refusal to cooperate marks the doom of the $CIVNOUN3. As soon as I get around to it. You just wait..."
"Insolence! You are fortunate that Mighty $CIVNAME5 doesn't wipe you off the face of the planet! We will not be so lenient next time!"
"I am very hurt and disappointed in you, $PLAYER0. I thought we were friends!"
"Oh, all right. In honor of the long friendship between $CIVNAME5 and $CIVNAME1, we won't destroy you this time. You're lucky that I'm an old softie..."
"You insolent dog! You will rue the day that you thwarted Mother $CIVNAME5! Ooo, you just wait..."
"You are foolish, but courageous. I congratulate you. You will survive, for now..."
"I would destroy you for your insolence, but, uh, the $CIVADJ6 people are feeling particularly merciful now. You should kiss our feet in gratitude."
"But of course! We were just kidding! Haha! Funny joke, eh?"
"It appears that I have underestimated you, $PLAYER0. Very well. We will let this lie, for the moment."
"That is right unfriendly, $PLAYER0. I'm disappointed in you. You are fortunate that we are a peace-loving people, or we'd smash you like the loathsome bugs you are."
"Confound you! Our armies will march on your cities - er, just as soon as we get around to it..."
"Ah so. Well, your insolence has been noted. We will remember, next time."
"So! You spurn our very reasonable request? We'll remember that, the next time you want something from us!"
"Barbarians are SO difficult to deal with. Well, we will let your pathetic civilization survive, for the moment, in the hope that with age comes wisdom."
"The $CIVADJ6 people appreciate courage - even suicidal courage - in others. We will refrain from crushing you this time. Go in peace."
"You refuse this very reasonable request from your great friend, $CIVNAME5? How disappointing. You are lucky that we are so merciful."
"It is impossible to deal reasonably with you! Ah - go away before we forget ourselves and do something righteous."
"So you refuse to contribute to the cause of peace, eh? How disappointing. I hope that you do not come to regret your foolish decision."
"I would grind your civilization into dust - er, if I weren't such a peace-loving person."
"After all that we have done for you, you refuse our very reasonable request? We will remember this!"
"WHAT? You refuse our tiny request? Such insolence cannot be tolerated! You just wait, see? Some day you'll get what's coming to you..."
"You've got guts. I like that. So I won't destroy you this time. But next time I may not be so merciful..."
"It is fortunate for you that your pathetic civilization isn't worth destroying!"
"That's it: you're on my list now, buddy. You'll get what's coming to you some day. See if you don't!"
"It's fortunate for you that we have all the sacrifices we need at the moment. Next time you may not be so lucky!"
"The gods instruct me to spare your pathetic civilization for the time being. What a disappointment."
"You are courageous, $PLAYER0. I honor you for it. You may go in peace."
"Your insolence has been noted, $PLAYER0. We will remember you."
"Very well. We will let you survive, for the moment. But we'll be back!"
"The $CIVADJ2 people have a courageous leader. I salute you!"
"This isn't over, $PLAYER0. Not by a long shot. I shall return!"
"Oh well. Can't blame a leader for trying, can you?"
"Oh, why do I even bother? Your puny civilization isn't worth the effort it would take to destroy."
"You spurn even our most reasonable requests! I am very disappointed in you, $PLAYER0! Well, see that it doesn't happen again or I shall be very cross!"
"This is a big, cold world, $PLAYER0. You should do more to keep what few friends you have. $CIVNAME5 will remember your uncooperativeness in the future."
"Very few individuals surprise $AI4. Pray that you don't continue to do so."
"Where has this new found backbone sprung from? When the $CIVNAME6 people find out, don't expect such tolerance as I demonstrate today."
"Wars have been started for less, but in this case your cities shall continue to stand. In this case."
"You savage, ill-mannered, muck-slinger! This is intolerable!"
"You will soon discover the gravity of your decision. Consider yourself warned."
"What?! I have been rebuffed by a primate? You will pay for this."
"Your un-mindfulness will be your ruin, $PLAYER0."
"Let no man glory in the greatness of his own mind, but rather keep watch of his own wit!"
"You are not free of fault, $PLAYER0. It is a miserable and evil man who makes a mockery of all things!"
"I expected more generosity from you, $PLAYER0. We will not forget this."
"You offend the $CIVADJ7 and shame your own people in this matter $PLAYER0! Your insolence has been noted."
"I, $AI4 the Great, am offended by your lack of cooperation in this! Do not expect me to be as civil in our future dealings."
"Hah! The older the buck, the harder the horn!"
"When the drink is in, the sense is out, $PLAYER0! I will return when you are sober."
"We will compose a death chant specifically for you, $PLAYER0, and we will chant it vigorously. You hear me?! VIGOROUSLY!"
"I see that you can not be swayed easily. While I respect your fortitude, your reputation as power-monger remains."
"I am merciful. I am forgiving. For now."
"You are flawed by greed, $PLAYER0. Someday, someone more virtuous than yourself shall introduce you to humility."
"While I am shocked that you would refuse my demands, $PLAYER0, I am impressed that you have called my bluff. Do not expect me to be so impressed next time."
"I see... next time I will not ask so politely, $PLAYER0. I will not be denied what I want so easily again."
"$PLAYER0, I have stricken your name from my list of civilizations that I was going to spare. If I were you, I would watch my back."
"You have smudged the honor of the $CIVADJ6 people, $PLAYER0. They will be furious when they hear of your insolence and greed."
"You have made a very grave mistake indeed, I will not forget this."
"I am appalled at how you treat your superiors! Perhaps you should consult your foreign advisor before making rash decisions in the future!"
"You may soon find that it was a very unwise decision to ignore my humble request, $PLAYER0."
"What?! You spurn my humble request? I, $AI4 of the mighty $CIVADJ6 empire, will not soon forget this rude rebuke."
"$PLAYER0, you are a brave fool to ignore my demand. My war council will soon convene to decide the fate of your pitiful lands and people.
"I am sorely tempted to give you a first hand demonstration of the mighty $CIVADJ6 war machine. But it will have to wait, as I presently have other matters to attend to."
"It is fortunate that the invincible $CIVADJ6 army is hotly engaged elsewhere, or the doom of the $CIVNOUN3 would be at hand."
"Some free advice for you, $PLAYER0, which I suggest you heed: Do not again ignore the demands of $CIVNAME5 or the price will be paid with the lives of many innocent $CIVADJ2 people."
"You are indeed fortunate, $PLAYER0, that $CIVNAME5 does not have a dire need of that tribute."
"Rather insolent of you to refuse that request, $PLAYER0. For the time being, however, I will let this rebuke pass. Count yourself lucky!"
"I, the great $AI4 of $CIVNAME5, am annoyed that you would dare to refuse my just demand. But not annoyed enough to mobilize my troops - yet."
"What?! You REFUSE?? Well..."
"I, $AI4 of $CIVNAME5, take your refusal to meet my demand as a personal affront. It will NOT be forgotten!"
"The insolence of $CIVNAME1 astounds me, but I should not be surprised, as uncouth barbarians and wild pigs are always difficult to deal with."
"Oh, dear me! Such effrontery to deny my polite request, $PLAYER0. And here all along I had thought you were born without a spine.”
"Very well then, we shall just have to do without.”
"That may end up costing you, $PLAYER0. But right now I must finish my painting of the remains of last night’s dinner before the paints harden."
“In time, $PLAYER0, you will come to regret your error.”
“The $CIVADJ2 civilization deserves wiser leadership, in a world as dangerous as this.  We hope you will come to your senses, $PLAYER0.”
“You choose to deny us our modest request, $PLAYER0.  Let us see how you survive the ravages of the world without the support of the $CIVADJ7.”
"You may soon learn that it was a very unwise decision to ignore my request, $PLAYER0. My patience is running thin, and the waters of Lake Titicaca yearn for your blood. Let this be a warning to you."
"What?! You spurn my generosity? I, $AI4 of the mighty $CIVADJ7 empire, will not soon forget this rude rebuke. The spires of the Andes Mountains will soon echo with the death howls of your people."
"$PLAYER0, you are a brave, but foolish, fool to ignore my demand. My war council will soon convene to decide the fate of your pitiful lands and people."
"I’m sorely tempted to give you a jaguar’s view of the mighty $CIVADJ6 war machine.  But it will have to wait, I’m afraid, as I have other matters to attend to at this moment. But please stay and enjoy our celebration of life… the bloodletting is about to begin."
"It is fortunate that the invincible $CIVADJ6 army is hotly engaged elsewhere, or the doom of the $CIVNOUN3 would be at hand."
"Some free advice for you, $PLAYER0: Do not ignore the demands of the jaguar and the $CIVADJ6 people, or the price will be the enslavement of many innocent $CIVADJ2 people."

"Noble $PLAYER0, our mutual treaty of peace is about to expire. It would be beneficial to both of our peoples that we continue to live in peace. Do you not agree?"
"Surely, in your wisdom, you can see that it will be in the best interest of your people if you choose to renew your treaty of peace with the mighty $CIVADJ5 empire. Or, is your wisdom as thin as the air in the Andes Mountains?"
"Ignore my strong hand of friendship at the dire peril of your sad empire, $PLAYER0. I am the Earth Shaker. May the mountains quake beneath my feet when I move against your pitiful lands."
"Our mutual Peace Treaty has served our peoples well.  Let us keep the peace, $PLAYER0, between our two lands."

"$PLAYER0! Immediately remove your troops from the area near $CITY3 or I will strike them down with great wrath."
"$CIVADJ2 troops have been seen near $CITY3. Surely there must have been some sort of training exercise that I was not made aware of, $PLAYER0?"
"I was not aware that $CIVNAME1 employed blind men, drunkards, and children as generals, $PLAYER0. How else would you explain the $CIVADJ2 presence near $CITY3?"

"$PLAYER0, $CIVADJ2 savages have been spotted near $CITY3. Please, remove them now, or I will make an example of them."
"Remove your troops from near $CITY3, before I dispose of them personally."
"My dear $PLAYER0, it seems that some of your troops have strayed a bit too far from their home. It would be wise of you to remove them from the vicinity of $CITY3."
"It is enough that I, the mighty $AI4 of $CIVNAME5, must suffer the folly of my own generals. Now, it seems, unwise $CIVADJ2 troops have strayed too close to $CITY3. Recall them - or else!"

"Very troubling, $PLAYER0, very troubling indeed. Please allow me to call to your attention the fact that some of your $CIVADJ2 forces threaten the peaceful citizens of $CITY3. Surely they will be departing soon?"
"Trespassing upon the holy ground of $CIVNAME5 is a crime of great magnitude, $PLAYER0. Perhaps you were not aware of this? Your troops near $CITY3 must depart immediately - or grave consequences will ensue!"
"Instruct your forces in the vicinity of $CITY3 to depart - or I will be forced to have my troops forcefully remove them!"
"$PLAYER0, the presence of $CIVADJ2 troops near the $CIVADJ6 city of $CITY3 is upsetting its citizenry... and worries me. Please, remove them soon."
"$PLAYER0, in case you were unaware, $CIVADJ2 troops have bumbled onto the sovereign lands of $CIVNAME5 near $CITY3. Will you recall them, or need they be forcibly removed?"
"Must we again resort to using spoiled fish to mask the stench of your $CIVADJ2 'warriors' near $CITY3, or will you have them immediately recalled?"
"$PLAYER0, perhaps you are unaware that $CIVADJ2 troops have crossed into $CIVNAME5 and are rudely trampling the beautiful flower gardens of $CITY3. Please, if you are a friend, recall them."
"Your troops are not exactly tip-toeing through the tulips of $CITY3, $PLAYER0. May I be so bold as to suggest that you recall them at once?"
"The foul odor of $CIVNAME1 grows strong around the beautiful $CIVADJ6 city of $CITY3. Have them removed - or they will all soon be fertilizer for our tulips!"
“$PLAYER0, there appear to be $CIVADJ2 units straying near the city of $CITY3.  I would not like our friendship tested so.”
“For a moment, I thought I saw a ragged band of stinking, drooling barbarians loitering near $CITY3, but then I realized they were merely $CIVADJ2 troops.  Perhaps they need reminding as to who rules them… for the present.”
“Your barbaric encroachments will not be tolerated an instant longer, $PLAYER0.  Retreat from $CIVADJ6 territory immediately or blood will spill.”
"My dear $PLAYER0, it seems that some of your troops have strayed a bit too far from their home. It would be wise of you to remove them from the vicinity of $CITY3, lest they be mistaken for Llamas and culled for meat."
"It is enough that I, Earth Shaker, $AI4 of the $CIVNAME5, must suffer the folly of my own generals. Now, it seems, unwise $CIVADJ2 troops have strayed too close to $CITY3. Recall them – or else they will be pummeled to meal under the mighty feet of our scouts!"

"Thrifty $CIVNAME4 is always happy to share its wealth with $CIVNAME1! For a small profit, of course..."

"We are always happy to lend you money, $PLAYER0 - at surprisingly high interest rates, that is."
"$CIVNAME4 doesn't have much, $PLAYER0, but we are happy to share what we do have with our friends the $CIVADJ2 people. Will you accept these terms?"

"$CIVNAME4 would be happy to grant $CIVNAME1 a small loan, $PLAYER0. Are these terms agreeable?"
"I would just give you the money if it were up to me, but I am required by law to charge a reasonable interest rate. Will you agree to these terms?"

"Do not say another word! Our coffers are open to our good friends, the people of $CIVNAME1! For a very, very small fee, of course..."
"Haven't your ignorant people learned the secrets of banking yet, $PLAYER0? Oh very well. Here are $CIVNAME4's terms."

"I have no reason to demonstrate such generosity, but you will no doubt accept it nonetheless."
"Our exploits in the new world have provided us with a small surplus of money. We can offer you a loan based on the following terms."
"Yes, we can grant you a loan, on our terms of course."
"A loan? I suppose that it would be a nice gesture on our part to help those who are far less fortunate."
"My horde of gold does me no good if I am unable to aid my friends, $PLAYER0. I will gladly offer this loan to you."
"Certainly. You too may be able to enjoy the fruits of our labor. Do these terms suit you, $PLAYER0?"
"Sometimes it is better to ask for too little, than for too much, $PLAYER0. We can offer you this loan, on our terms."
"$PLAYER0, after taking a refreshing swim in the gold heaps located throughout my treasury, I realized that we currently have a surplus of money! I can indeed offer you a loan at this time if that is what you truly desire."

"Accept this offering and bestow its bounty upon your offspring."
"Though you have been scornful of my beliefs and methods in the past, I still have faith that you will someday see the error of your ways. I can provide you with this loan."
"$CIVNAME4 war exploits have been very profitable, $PLAYER0. I can indeed offer you this loan, at this time."

"Yes, here is what we are prepared to offer you. Please use this to supplement your meager armies, $PLAYER0. I have my own struggles and will not always be able to bail you out."
"I would gladly help out a dutiful friend in a time of need."
"Yes, of course, here are our terms."

"Well, well, well, look who has come begging for money! Yes, $PLAYER0, $CIVNAME4 will help to bail you out this time - but only if you agree to these terms."
"The beneficent $AI3 of $CIVNAME4 will grant you a loan, $PLAYER0. Will you agree to these generous terms?"
"Yes, I believe a loan can be arranged, $PLAYER0, but it comes at a small price. Are these terms acceptable?"
"Against my better judgment I will grant you a loan $PLAYER0. Fault on these terms and the price may be your head. Do you agree?"
"$PLAYER0, perhaps a small loan from $CIVNAME4 will help to ease the financial burdens of $CIVNAME1?"
"Agreed, but first - here are my terms."
"It leaves a bad taste in my mouth, but - just this once - I will grant you a loan. But be advised, $PLAYER0, there are a few strings attached."
“In troubled times it is essential for the forces of order and civilization to assist one another when the barbarians come knocking.  We will help you now.”
“The vast $CIVADJ5 treasury can barely notice the loss of this bagatelle, $PLAYER0.  Nonetheless, do not take our generosity for granted.”
“We hand over this treasure against our better judgment, $PLAYER0.  Ensure the repayment is swift and sufficient, or there will be dire consequences.”
"My most trusted priests inform me that meeting your polite request would be wise. Here is what you desire, noble $PLAYER0. May the sun god have mercy on your soul."
"Let it not be uttered that the people of the $CIVNAME4 are ungenerous. Take this and be off. Go quickly, and do not let the shadows of the Andes fall upon your minions again."
"It disturbs me, Earth Shaker $AI3 of the $CIVNAME4, that my council suggests that I honor your greedy demand. It is most unlikely that you will be so fortunate again."
"As always, the $CIVADJ5 kingdom is always willing to help out a friend.  Is this acceptable, $PLAYER0?"

"Hmmm. You wish peace, eh? Well, $GET3 would help us to forget our many grievances against your outlaw civilization..."
"If you wish to end this war, you must pay us $GET3. End of discussion."
"Come. Let us end this unfortunate conflict. All we ask in return is $GET3."
"At last you have come to your senses. Give us $GET3 and you'll have peace with $CIVNAME5."
"Mighty $CIVNAME5 will refrain from eradicating $CIVNAME1 for the paltry fee of $GET3."
"We shall forget our grievances against $CIVNAME1 for $GET3. Surely peace is worth that price to you?"
"So. You come begging Mighty $CIVNAME5 for peace, eh? Well, you shall have it - for a fee."
"If you wish to extend your pathetic existence, you'll give us what we want. Now!"
"$CIVNAME5 will agree to peace with Mighty $CIVNAME1. All we ask is a small token of respect and friendship."
"We will end this war, but you must make reparations for your many crimes."
"$CIVNAME5 will forgive your many insults against her people, but only if you'll meet her price."
"Peace? I too long for peace! Will you agree to pay this paltry fee to assuage the feelings of the $CIVADJ6 people?"
"At last you have come to realize that resistance is futile. Will you accept this price?"
"Ah. It was only a matter of time before you realized the superiority of the $CIVADJ6 people. We will give you peace in exchange for $GET3."
"The $CIVADJ6 people are always ready for peace. We will end this conflict in exchange for a small goodwill gift."
"Have you come to your senses at last, then? Excellent. This war has cost my people a lot, $PLAYER0. We demand that you pay reparations."
"If you wish to end this war, $PLAYER0, you'll have to pay for it."
"My people have suffered much at your hands, $PLAYER0. If you want peace, you'll have to help make good their suffering."
"So you finally admit defeat! Peace will cost you $GET3. Pay it or continue suffering."
"Why should we stop fighting? We are destroying you! If you want peace, you must meet our price!"
"Blessed are the peacemakers, $PLAYER0. Give us $GET3, and we will once more resume our long and happy friendship!"
"So you think you can just buy off the righteous anger of the $CIVADJ6 people, eh? Congratulations: you are correct. Here's our price."
"You humble yourself before us, pleading for the survival of your vanquished civilization? We will be merciful - if you'll pay us what we are due."
"We both must be willing to make sacrifices for peace, $PLAYER0. Will you sacrifice, say, $GET3?"
"After all that you have done to us, peace will cost you."
"$GET3 will purchase the survival of your beaten people, $PLAYER0."
"Well, if it were up to me, I'd continue fighting until the bitter end. But, for the sake of both our people, I'll end this war in exchange for a small bribe."
"If you wish peace with $CIVNAME5, you'll have to pay for it. Frankly, I hope you'll refuse."
"This will cost you, $PLAYER0. We've got the upper hand and you know it!"
"The gods demand a sacrifice from you, $PLAYER0, if you wish to make peace with the Mighty $CIVADJ7."
"We $CIVADJ7 live for war! Peace will cost you plenty."
"The Mighty $CIVADJ7 have triumphed over you! Admit it, pay our war reparations, and survive for another day. Refuse and perish."
"This war is an insult to the gods, $PLAYER0. Meet my price and we can have peace!"
"Peace with the $CIVADJ7 will cost you, $PLAYER0. Pay up or die."
"Bootlicking dog! You will meet my price, or your entire civilization will perish at the end of $CIVADJ6 spears!"
"The war between the $CIVADJ7 and $CIVNAME1 will end, if you will pay our very reasonable price."
"We are not quite yet ready for peace, $PLAYER0. You'll have to make it worth my people's while."
"At last the cowardly $CIVADJ2 people come begging for their lives! I am mightily pleased. Here is the price for sparing your pathetic civilization."
"The $CIVADJ7 will happily sign a peace treaty with you, $PLAYER0. Now, about our very reasonable fee..."
"You want peace, eh? Well, here are our demands..."
"We will spare your pathetic civilization in return for the following concessions:"
"Wisdom is not a characteristic the $CIVNAME1 have demonstrated in the past, but things can change. Deliver $GET3 and we shall stay our horde."
"Many battles have demonstrated an almost $CIVADJ6-like ability to wage war. This we respect and offer you a chance to live another day."
"Taking the lives of your $CIVADJ2 warriors have begun to bore us. Can we not end this hostility so that the $CIVADJ7 might find a more worthy foe?"
"You are correct, this war is dull and pointless, $PLAYER0. Shall we kiss and make up? First, I require $GET3."
"Why do we fight so? This war is so unbecoming a person of my stature. Let us end it now with this peace treaty."
"Do you admit defeat, $PLAYER0? Will you accept the following treaty based on these terms?"
"You offer sage advice, $PLAYER0. We could guarantee peace if we were to receive $GET3."
"I agree, it is time to end this strife between us. Are you willing to part with $GET3 to accomplish this?"
"Your actions prove that even fools can make wise decisions, $PLAYER0. Concede $GET3 to us and we will agree to a truce."
"The $CIVADJ6 tire of this war, $PLAYER0. This conflict renders both of us blind to others who might plot against us. Let us cease this petty scuffle and focus on more nefarious enemies."
"Our vaults bleed money, and the families of our troops lament their absence. Let us call a truce and begin the rebuilding process in both of our empires. Join me in this treaty."
"While the $CIVADJ6 people have profited from this war, we feel that it is time for this conflict to end. Peace comes at a price, and that price is: $GET3."
"It is a shame that you wish to end our ritual combat so soon, $PLAYER0. You have been an admirable opponent."
"$PLAYER0, we will forgive your insults, in exchange for $GET3. I look forward to our next bout."
"It offends me how you give up so easily, $PLAYER0! I demand that you provide a more formidable challenge next time! Until then, I require $GET3 to forget about all of this."
"Yes, you are right... I beg for your forgiveness in this matter. We have wronged you and the $CIVADJ2 people. Shall we seal this treaty with $GET3?"
"Your mercy is prized, dear $PLAYER0. We will tell our forces to stand down at once, once we receive $GET3."
"The lamb speaks of peace to the lion? Well then! The lion requires $GET3 to sate his appetite in spite of the lamb's succulent chops."
"You have been a worthy opponent, $PLAYER0. I admire your determination. Perhaps we can reconcile our differences?"
"Let it not be said that I am without mercy, $PLAYER0. This is your one and only chance to end this war. I suggest that you take it."
"$PLAYER0! The lion is upon your throat. You must ask yourself: 'Do I want to live to fight another day, or be crushed in its jaws?'"
"Let us end this foolish war once and for all. Sign this treaty and we will try to put the past behind us."
"I tire of this pointless war... let us agree to disagree; how about a truce?"
"While we do enjoy stomping upon the heads of the misguided $CIVADJ2 people, we tire of their wailing. Accept this treaty and remove yourself from my sight."
"Indeed, perhaps peace WOULD be in the best interest of both of our peoples. As a gesture of good faith I humbly ask that you grant the $CIVADJ6 people $GET3."
"You wish peace? Much $CIVADJ6 blood has been shed. Perhaps $GET3 will help us forget the transgressions of your war dogs."
"So, you have at last seen the futility of waging war against the powerful $CIVADJ6 empire? Immediately dispatch $GET3 and I will mercifully allow your sad civilization to live - for now."
"The people of $CIVNAME5 also grow weary of this war. I have consulted my council, and it is agreed that we will accept peace in exchange for $GET3."
"You make war upon the $CIVADJ6 civilization and then ask for terms? Well, here are my terms. Accept them or the bloodletting will continue!"
"The lions of $CIVNAME5 are at your gates, thirsty for $CIVADJ2 blood, and now you seek peace? I will recall my warriors, $PLAYER0 - IF you agree to these terms."
"$CIVNAME5 will agree to end this conflict - but only if you are willing to grant her $GET3 as a sign of your good intentions."
"I, $AI4, also long for peace. To partially offset the cost of reparations, however, you must be willing to grant $CIVNAME5 $GET3. Then we will have peace."
"Yes, conditionally. Give $CIVNAME5 $GET3 and we can put an end to this conflict."
"You have wrongly waged a cruel war upon the $CIVADJ7, $PLAYER0. It is about time you saw the error of your ways and sought peace. Here are the terms I will agree to."
"Yes, let there again be peace in our lands, $PLAYER0. Here are the terms. I trust you will find them acceptable."
"Even though the tide of war has turned against you, $PLAYR0, I too see the benefits of peace. I have decided to grant your request in exchange for $GET3. Will you accept?"
"It has been a glorious struggle, $PLAYER0, but the $CIVADJ7 also grow tired. Yes, we shall have peace again - if you agree give us $GET3."
"So, $PLAYER0! You now have neither heart nor stomach for this bloody conflict? Very well, give $CIVNAME5 $GET3 and we’ll end it before you also lose your head."
"You grow tired of the pounding, eh, $PLAYER0? I will recall my victorious armies, but only if you agree to hand over $GET3. Do we have a deal?"
“This war has been exhausting for both of our proud empires, $PLAYER0.  Perhaps a small token – say, $GET3 – might speed the healing of our wounds.”
“The danger the $CIVADJ2 empire poses to the civilized peoples of the world cannot be denied, $PLAYER0, but if you give us $GET3 we may be tempted to look the other way… for now.”
“If you give us $GET3, $PLAYER0, $CIVNAME5 will postpone the utter destruction of your barbaric rabble.”
"Indeed, perhaps peace WOULD be in the best interest of both of our peoples. As a gesture of good faith, I humbly ask that you grant the $CIVADJ6 people $GET3. And make haste with your decision, my humble adversary, lest the sun god shines no more upon your doorstep."
"You wish peace? Much $CIVADJ6 blood has been shed. Perhaps $GET3 will help us forget the transgressions of your war dogs."
"So, you have at last seen the futility of waging war against the powerful $CIVADJ6 empire? Immediately proffer $GET3 and I, the Earth Shaker, will mercifully allow your sad civilization to live – for now."
"The people of the $CIVNAME5 also grow weary of this war.  I have consulted my priests, and it is agreed that we will accept peace in exchange for $GET3."
"You make war upon the $CIVADJ6 civilization and then ask for terms?  Well, here are my terms.  Accept them or the bloodletting and the enslavement will continue!"
"The bloodthirsty jaguars of the $CIVNAME5 are at your gates, and now you seek peace?  I will recall my warriors so that they do not crush your miserable civilization, $PLAYER0 – IF you agree to these terms."

"Fool! Do you think we are frightened of your puny soldiers? Well, as fate would have it, we are. We agree."
"Uh, well, I guess peace would be in the interests of both our countries. Yeah..."
"You make a - potent argument, $PLAYER0. I accept."
"I see. Well, we're no fools. $CIVNAME5 accepts your offer of peace."
"This is a bitter pill for us to swallow, $PLAYER0. But it seems we have no choice. $CIVNAME5 accepts your offer of peace."
"We do not fear your soldiers, $PLAYER0... But perhaps we should end this now, before there is more bloodshed. We accept your offer of peace."
"Peace? Why, uh, certainly! This is just what $CIVNAME5 was hoping would happen! Excellent!"
"Ah well, it was a good war while it lasted. We accept your offer of peace."
"Peace cannot be purchased by threat of arms, $PLAYER0. But it CAN be rented for a while. $CIVNAME5 accepts your offer of peace. For now."
"$CIVNAME5 is happy to take the hand of $CIVNAME1 in friendship. Yeah. Happy."
"You have stolen a march on us, $PLAYER0. I salute you. We have no choice but to accept your offer of peace."
"We agree to peace - for now. But this isn't finished, not by a long shot!"
"Haha! Certainly, we agree to peace! It was all a misunderstanding anyway..."
"Apparently I have no choice but to agree to peace with $CIVNAME1. How disappointing."
"$CIVNAME5 will agree to peace with the $CIVNOUN3, for now. But we may not be so accommodating next time..."
"Peace? Why, certainly! $CIVNAME5 is EAGER to resume friendly relations with $CIVNAME1!"
"It appears that you have the upper hand, $PLAYER0. We have no choice but to agree to peace."
"War is SO tiresome, don't you agree? I accept your offer of peace."
"As spring is superior to winter, so too is peace superior to war. I salute you for recognizing this, $PLAYER0. We accept your offer."
"When two tigers have each other by the throat, lowly jackals get all the meat. We agree to peace - may it be a lasting one!"
"$CIVNAME5 accepts your offer of peace. Now I recommend that you remove your troops from our presence before we change our mind!"
"We $CIVADJ7 prefer peace to war. Particularly when it's war we might lose. We accept your terms."
"As long as it's peace with honor, we accept."
"Very well. We will give peace a chance. See to it that you are not the first to break it!"
"War! Huh - good god, y'all! What is it good for? Absolutely nothing! We accept your offer of peace."
"You show sense, $PLAYER0. You have a small advantage at the moment, and yet you still seek peace. That is wisdom indeed. We accept your offer."
"My generals will hate me for it, but I accept your offer."
"It is generous of you to offer an enemy peace even as your forces march on her cities. $CIVNAME5 accepts your offer."
"It is bitter to negotiate with someone who is marching on one's cities, but in the interests of world peace, I must accept your offer."
"$CIVNAME5 accepts $CIVNAME1's offer of peace. I pray that it is a lasting one."
"$CIVNAME5 welcomes the chance to clasp $PLAYER0's hand in friendship! We agree."
"The $CIVADJ6 people also long for peace, $PLAYER0! We gladly accept your offer!"
"We agree. Let us hope, for both our people's sake, that the peace is a lasting one."
"Mighty $AI4 agrees to accept your offer of peace - but only to spare the $CIVADJ2 citizens much agony. You're welcome."
"$CIVNAME5 accepts your offer of peace. Say... Perhaps we should ally together and pick on somebody smaller than us. What do you think?"
"Hmmm. Come to think of it, your tiny civilization has little that we want. So we'll agree to peace. Until you get something worth fighting over."
"Well, I guess I have no choice at the moment, do I? This is really disappointing."
"Oh, all right! Have it your way. We agree to stop the hostilities. For now."
"The $CIVADJ6 people clamor for peace with $CIVNAME1. Personally, I'd rather poke myself in the eye with a pointed stick, but what can you do? The will of the people and all that..."
"Agreed! You are too merciful, for your own good, $PLAYER0. If I were in your shoes I'd wipe me out without a second thought."
"You cravenly seek peace just as the real battle is about to begin? Pah - you are not even worth fighting! We agree. Now get out of our territory."
"Your threats don't bother us a bit, $PLAYER0. However, it just so happens that peace IS in our best interests at this time. Really."
"The $CIVADJ6 people are eager to sit down and smoke the pipe of peace with their friends, the people of $CIVNAME1! We accept your offer!"
"We're no fools. $AI4 accepts your offer of peace."
"It appears that I have no choice but to accept your offer. For the moment."
"You know, I don't even remember what we were fighting over in the first place! Isn't that amusing? Of course we accept your offer of peace!"
"Hmmm. I must admit that you do have the upper hand... Oh all right: you shall have your peace."
"$CIVNAME5 agrees - with great reluctance. Congratulations, $PLAYER0. You have gotten the upper hand, for the moment."
"I shall not forgive this $PLAYER0, nor forget. But until...another time...we are at peace."
"The use of arms has been proven inappropriate in this instance. Watch your back, $PLAYER0, but for now our armies shall stand down."
"Your attempt to dominate the $CIVADJ7 has failed... in some regards. In others it's less incomplete. We shall stay our blades."
"Yes, in the interest of world peace, we will stand down, $PLAYER0."
"It would appear that you have the upper hand, $PLAYER0. We will yield."
"We do not fear your soldiers, $PLAYER0, but we will agree to this proposal of peace."
"Your snarls frighten and bewilder us, $PLAYER0. We will submit."
"Agreed! We will call off our raiders once this treaty is finalized."
"Of course you press us for peace! You would be a fool not to. In either case, we accept."
"Your soldiers show no mercy, $PLAYER0. We would like to wash our hands of this war. We will yield."
"We admire the tenacity of the $CIVADJ2 people, $PLAYER0. We will agree to cease fighting if only to delay the inevitable."
"The $CIVADJ6 people do not fear you or the $CIVADJ2, $PLAYER0; but we do dread wasting any more time in such a fruitless war. We will agree to peace, based on these terms."
"Peace? It seems I have no other choice, for now."
"You are so righteous and persistent, $PLAYER0! We will yield."
"Well, well, well... when did you grow a spine, $PLAYER0? We will accept your terms, but only because you amuse me."
"Yes, the sheer magnitude of your forces gives us reason to pause and reflect upon the error of our ways. We will yield for now."
"Despite your meaningless threats, you are correct, we tire of this conflict. *SIGH* What ever happened to the good-old-days when wars were fought with sticks and stones?"
"Yes. We will stay our hand, if only to allow you more time to contemplate the frail nature of your existence."
"Ah Hah! I see that you are both bold, and daring, $PLAYER0. We will accept your offer of peace."
"When two lions have each other by the throat, the hyenas steal away with the meat. We will agree to this truce, $PLAYER0."
"Groveling seems to suit you better than these half-hearted threats, $PLAYER0. We will accept these terms, if only to allow you some dignity."
"A peace treaty... does this mean I have to scrap my plans for redecorating your palace?"
"Yes, you are right; neither of us has accomplished anything by pursuing this war. Let us put aside our differences and embrace peace."
"Of course we will accept your treaty! We have been more than willing to give peace a chance, but you probably did not hear us crying over the din of your artillery fire."
"I, the humble $AI4, shall be glad to take your hand in peace. Let us vow to not make war again."
"My council has decided to accept your gracious offer of peace, $PLAYER0. It is unfortunate that so much blood had to be shed."
"We accept your offer, but note that your vain attempt to force the people of $CIVNAME5 to carry your yoke has failed. It is wise you decided to choose peace before my brave legions laid waste to your land and people."
"It just so happens that I, the great $AI4, am willing to accept your generous terms."
"Your offer is acceptable; let us have peace once more. The lions of $CIVNAME5 will sheath their sharp fangs."
"Agreed; let us have peace. You are most fortunate, $PLAYER0, that my ministers advised me to accept your terms, for my warriors were having much fun ravaging your pitiful lands."
"Accepting these terms leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, $PLAYER0."
"These terms are acceptable, $PLAYER0."
"With much reluctance your peace offer has been accepted - but only because $AI4 has much more important matters to attend to elsewhere."
"There is a foul odor to this proposal, $PLAYER0. I have seldom smelled worse in the fish market of Lisbon. However, for the sake of the $CIVADJ6 people I have agreed to the terms."
"Yes, $PLAYER0, the terms you offer are acceptable."
"Against all reason, $PLAYER0, I agree to your offer. Lucky for you that there are so many better things for the $CIVADJ7 to do in this wide world than to annihilate your pitiful civilization."
"A marvelous idea, $PLAYER0! I was just thinking the same thing myself."
"Certainly, $PLAYER0 - the $CIVADJ7 are a peace-loving people."
"We accept your offer, but only because the recent heavy rains have caused many of our dikes to overflow and my troops are needed at home. This is not over by a long shot.”
“I accept the $CIVADJ2 terms, $PLAYER0, but do not mistake assent for weakness.”
“$CIVNAME5 accepts your terms.”
“Other threats loom on the horizon, $PLAYER0.  For this reason alone, $CIVNAME5 grants your pitiful empire a stay of execution.”
"I, the humble $AI4, shall be glad to take your hand in peace. Let us vow to not make war again."
"I have decided to accept your gracious offer of peace, $PLAYER0. It is unfortunate that so much blood had to be shed."
"We accept your offer, but your vain attempt to force the people of the $CIVNAME5 to carry your yoke has failed. It is wise you decided to choose peace before my brave legions laid waste to your land and people."
"It just so happens that I, the great $AI4, am willing to accept your generous terms. You caught me on a good day, $PLAYER0. Don’t make a habit of it."
"Your offer is acceptable; let us give peace a chance.  The jaguars of the $CIVNAME5 will lay their javelins down."
"Agreed; let us give peace a change. You are most fortunate, $PLAYER0, that my priests advised me to accept your terms, for my warriors were having much fun ravaging your pitiful lands and enslaving your youth."

"No, you shall not have peace - not until the rivers of $CIVNAME1 run red with yet more $CIVADJ2 blood."
"You cannot frighten the $CIVADJ6 people, $PLAYER0. We will not be cowed into surrender and living under the unjust yoke of $CIVNAME1."
"Although the $CIVADJ7 are a peace-loving folk, we feel you have not yet learned the proper lesson. The war shall continue."

"Unfortunately, I cannot call off my brave jaguars.  We are committed to our course, and would rather die proud than live in servitude.  Long live the $CIVNAME5!"
"The $CIVADJ6 people are not intimidated by your empty threats, nor will they accept your ungenerous terms."
"How stupid of you to think that the $CIVNAME5 would agree to such an offer.  No!  Crushing your civilization is good practice for my brave troops."

"$CIVNAME1 is outmatched: admit it. We will let your civilization survive in exchange for the following:"
"Come, come! There is no problem that cannot be solved if men of goodwill and reason will only sit down together and talk! Will you accept this deal and end this brutal conflict?"
"$PLAYER0, my people seek peace. Against my better judgment, I will offer you this deal."

"It often amuses me to envision a universe in which the $CIVADJ7 are not slaughtering the $CIVNOUN3. Perhaps we can bring this vision to reality."
"Congratulations for dulling our blade on your bones. We can resharpen them, or we can save them for another foe."
"We have only ourselves to blame for this war, $PLAYER0. I am forgiving, are you?"
"This war is going nowhere, $PLAYER0. Let us put the past behind us with this peace treaty."
"Sign this form, live another day, etcetera etcetera..."
"It is a wise man who uses his might in measured doses, $PLAYER0. It is time to end this war. Will you agree to these terms?"
"A well counseled man would realize that this peace proposal is both fair and timely, $PLAYER0."
"I realized now that fools will continue to be fools, despite war and despite peace, $PLAYER0. Do you still desire to play the part of the dead fool?"
"Our nations' children fade away into battle as if being swallowed by some great void. There is seemingly no end to the horrors of this war. If we work together we can put an end to all this bloodshed. Do you agree?"
"The only thing this war will accomplish is mutually assured destruction. I do not wish to waste my energy, or the energy of the $CIVADJ6 people pursuing such a wasteful exploit. Will you agree to a treaty?"
"Despite an uproar from my people to wipe the $CIVNAME1 from this planet, I suggest that we settle our differences another way. Truce?"

"Peace is better than decapitation, $PLAYER0."
"Grinning fool! Take this offer now, as I may never be this generous again."
"While we realize that we can never completely undo the damage which we have wrought, we are willing take the first step towards bridging this schism between us with a peace treaty. Will you accept these terms?"

"It is time that we end this war, $PLAYER0. Join me in this treaty."
"Often, the bravest man is he who is willing to admit defeat, $PLAYER0. Only a fool would continue to press his luck in this war."
"I no longer wish to be your accomplice in this quest for mutually assured destruction. Join me in this treaty, before it is too late."
"The $CIVADJ6 people no longer have the time or energy to quarrel with you over such petty matters. Here is what I propose."

"$PLAYER0, have mercy on poor $CIVNAME5. This war has caused much pain and suffering. Let us be honorable and put an end to the slaughter. Please consider these terms:"
"It is the wish of $CIVNAME5 that this conflict ends. Hopefully it is also the wish of $CIVNAME1."
"The prudent coarse would probably be to annihilate the $CIVADJ2 people. However, in the name of mercy, $CIVNAME5 grants these terms. Be not foolish and discard them, $PLAYER0, or the end of $CIVNAME1 could be at hand."
"$PLAYER0, I see now that this war was a mistake. I beseech you, be merciful and accept these terms."
"This war is destroying our lands and our people, $PLAYER0, while others grow stronger. Let us end this senseless conflict. Will you agree to these terms?"
"This war continues to destroy our people and our lands, while others grow stronger. It would be wise of you, $PLAYER0, to accept these more-than-generous terms I now offer."
"$PLAYER0, $CIVNAME5 is a small nation and in need of peace. Please, $PLAYER0, be merciful and consider these terms."
"Where have all the flowers gone, $PLAYER0? Let us end this senseless conflict and reap the fruits of peace."
"$PLAYER0, face reality: mighty $CIVNAME5 could easily crush $CIVNAME1. But we don’t desire your destruction. Instead we offer these terms. Refuse this at the peril of what remains of your puny civilization."
“Your armies prove better trained than we had thought, $PLAYER0.  Perhaps both $CIVNAME1 and $CIVNAME5 might benefit from finding easier prey.”
“Our soldiers long for home, $PLAYER0, and no doubt the $CIVADJ2 soldiers do too.  Let us end this senseless conflict.”
“There is no reason the people of $CIVNAME1 should suffer unduly for the failings of their leadership.  If you accept our terms, perhaps they can look forward to secure and civilized lives.”
"Let us end this senseless war before more innocent lives are lost. $PLAYER0, I hope you are wise enough to accept my generous terms, or is your wisdom as thin as the air in the Andes?"
"This war has lasted long enough. It would be wise of you to accept these generous terms, $PLAYER0, for the welfare of your people, and for the glory of MY empire."
"It has been an honor to slay so many of your pitiful troops, $PLAYER0. Accept these terms for even you can see that yet more shall perish beneath the feet of the Earth Shaker."
"The people of the $CIVNAME5 tire of this senseless conflict.  Accept these terms, $PLAYER0, and we can establish a lasting peace."
"Let us cage the jaguar of war so that our two peoples can again live in peace.  Will you accept these terms or shall I show you to my slave pit?"
"I offer you way out of death and enslavement, $PLAYER0.  Accept these generous terms and you shall have peace."

"Offal! After all the vile transgressions that the $CIVNOUN3 have visited upon the lands of $CIVNAME5, did you REALLY expect me to accept?"
"That offer smells worse than putrid offal, $PLAYER0. The killing shall continue."
"No. The $CIVADJ7 live for adventure and danger, and war has full measures of each."
"But that would ruin all the fun!"
"Hmm. It seems that $PLAYER0 is getting a little tired of fighting, eh? What a wimp!"
"$CIVADJ6 honor demands that the war continue!"
"Getting some splinters in your behind, $PLAYER0? Good! Turn around and let me kick you again!"
"Not likely. We’re having too much fun."
“$CIVNAME5 does not compromise with barbarians, $PLAYER0.  Nor do we make peace with them, while they still pose even a small threat to the civilized $CIVADJ6 people.”
“Only when $CIVNAME1 has bent the knee, and submitted entirely to $CIVNAME5, can this war end.”
“The moment of our triumph is at hand, $PLAYER0.  Do you seriously expect us to toss it away?”
“The future is in our hands, $PLAYER0, and it will remain so.  We cannot allow the world’s destiny to be dictated by thugs and slaves.”
“There’s a great chariot race starting in a few minutes, $PLAYER0, so I have even less time than usual to waste with your pathetic entreaties.”
“We would prefer not to have to lay waste to all the $CIVADJ2 cities, $PLAYER0, but doing so creates a warm and fulfilling sensation in me.  All will rest easier when $CIVNAME1 is just a few sentences in a book of history.”
"It is with much joy that I must inform you that your terms have been rejected. Prepare the people of $CIVNAME1 for more death!"
"There shall be no peace until all of your dogs of war have been laid to rest and the nations of the earth have forgotten the name of the pitiful $CIVADJ2 people. I am the Earth Shaker, and you are not as important!"
"This silly little offer of peace is an obvious sign of the weakness of the $CIVNOUN3. You would do well to prepare your subjects for more death, for as certain as the Andes Mountains rise into the clouds, so too will you perish before my thundering."
"It shall not be so. The war will continue and the earth will tremble in my wake!"
"Losing your backbone for war, $PLAYER0? The legions of the $CIVNAME5 will not rest until the $CIVADJ2 people lay prostrate before them. My glorious and imperial roads will flow red with the blood of your dead."
"A foolish request from a foolish leader. Instead, I think that we should let this war play itself out a bit more; I am winning, after all."
"Ha! We laugh in your face!"
"Not likely.  This war shall continue until WE wish it to end – not you!"
"No! The brave jaguars of the $CIVNAME5 will not rest until the pitiful $CIVADJ2 people grovel beneath their fierce paws!"
"Not a chance.  The slaughter and enslavement shall continue!"

"Blessed are the peacemakers, $PLAYER0! Let us sign a treaty together and end war on this world forever!"
"You need $CIVNAME4's protection, $PLAYER0. I urge you to accept this offer."
"$CIVNAME1 will not profit if $CIVNAME4 is consumed by a stronger foe. I urge you to sign this defensive alliance now."

"Your nation is vulnerable to attack, $PLAYER0; this does not suit $CIVNAME4's strategic objectives. Will you accept our protection?"
"$CIVNAME4 has no quarrel with $CIVNAME1, $PLAYER0. Let us sign a mutual protection pact to cement the peace between us!"
"If we can be sure that we will not be attacked by each other, then we can concentrate more energy against our REAL foes. Will you ally with $CIVNAME4?"

"Our two nations are destined to rule the world side by side, $PLAYER0. Why not begin now?"
"Ah, $PLAYER0! So GOOD of you to drop by! Mighty $CIVNAME4 is making you an offer you can't refuse. So don't."
"Your demonstrated cruelty on the battlefield is an inspiration, $PLAYER0. Join with the $CIVNOUN6 and we shall lay waste to the entire world!"
"Perhaps our initial estimates of your inferiority were premature. A pact may help further clear this possible misconception."
"The focus of our rage has shifted from your worthless, mud crawling peasants. Take this pact and perhaps it shall not fall on the $CIVNAME1 again."
"We would benefit greatly if we were to align our forces as one, $PLAYER0. Don't you agree?"
"Greetings, $PLAYER0. Shall we unite our great nations in this pact for mutually assured protection?"
"Despite their flaws, we do retain a definite interest in protecting the $CIVADJ2 people. Will you agree to this pact?"
"Never walk away from home ahead of your axe and sword, $PLAYER0. You cannot feel battle in your bones nor have foresight for a fight. Don't you agree?"
"You never know when you will find a fiercer foe than yourself, $PLAYER0. When that time comes you will certainly need an ally. Join me."
"A coward lives, believing that he might keep himself safe from strife. Old age leaves him not long in peace, though spears may spare his life. Join me, and leave your mundane life behind, $PLAYER0!"
"Our enemies assemble and plot our downfall, $PLAYER0! Join me in this pact so that our troops might fight side by side against our foes!"
"The $CIVADJ5 people would never hesitate to aid the $CIVNAME1 in a time of need. Let us unite in this pact, as brothers against our common enemies!"
"This is a dirty and brutal world, brother. You may certainly not get to pick your friends in a time of need. Might I suggest that you pick them now?"
"There are many snakes about, $PLAYER0. I will watch your back if you promise to watch mine."
"The earth, she can be cruel! We should band together, $PLAYER0, and help each other endure!"
"Do you need protection, little one?"
"$PLAYER0, let us unite our forces so that the schemes of our adversaries may be thwarted righteously!"
"Will you not help us ward off evil, $PLAYER0? Join us in this mutual protection pact, for the sake of both our nations."
"It is important to be wary of the corruptors who surround us, $PLAYER0. Allow me to take your fledgling civilization under my wing via this mutual protection pact, so that you too may be spared from their schemes."
"Join the Lion's Brood in the defense of the $CIVADJ5 people and the Lion's Brood will protect the sovereignty of $CIVADJ2 cities with ferocity, as if they were our own."
"Movements come, and movements go, $PLAYER0. By uniting our nations in this pact, we will ensure our place in history, as a force to be reckoned with."
"Even pacifists need protection from time to time, $PLAYER0. You are indeed vulnerable, and now is the time."
"$PLAYER0, you have indeed been a dutiful friend to the $CIVADJ5 people. I believe that it would be most beneficial if we combined our forces. Do you agree?"

"Come, $PLAYER0, and allow $CIVNAME4 to bring $CIVNAME1 under its powerful wing."

“It is not often that $CIVNAME4 encounters an empire so nearly our equal.  If we unite against invaders, our combined might can keep the light of civilization and progress aflame forever.”
“The time must come for each ruler to make his choice – will he use his influence to protect what is great and beautiful in the world, or will he tear it down?  Join with us and the barbarians may yet be kept in their caves a few centuries longer.”
“$CIVNAME4 has need of your nation’s meager armed forces as vassals.  Perhaps, if you fight alongside the noble and formidable $CIVADJ5 armies, in time you will come to achieve your own distinction in battle.”
"The prowess of the $CIVADJ2 troops on the battlefield is spoken about along my imperial roads, and my tambos rumble with great stories of great warriors. Please consider accepting this treaty of mutual protection, noble $PLAYER0."

"$PLAYER0, I demand that $CIVADJ5 troops be allowed to pass through $CIVNAME1. Sign this treaty now, and I will consider granting $CIVADJ2 troops the same privilege in $CIVNAME4."
“The threats that lurk just outside our two empires’ borders will need to be dealt with quickly and decisively.  Were $CIVADJ5 and $CIVADJ2 troops permitted to move freely within one another’s territory, that goal would become much closer.”
“The situation around us suggests that a Right of Passage agreement could help each of us achieve our military goals.  Do you not agree, $PLAYER0?”
“$CIVADJ5 armies require the use of your territory as a staging area.”
"It is with pleasure, $PLAYER0, that I will allow the fleet-of-foot warriors of $CIVNAME1 to traverse the imperial roads of the $CIVNAME4. In return, I request the same honor of you."

"Noble $PLAYER0, I seek the right of passage through your land for my warriors.  We, in turn, will allow $CIVNAME1 troops to pass through our lands as necessary. Is this not a good deal?"
"$PLAYER0, by the good grace of jaguar, I, the wondrous $AI3, will allow your troops right of passage over sacred $CIVADJ5 ground, but only if you will, in turn, permit the same for my warriors.  Do you agree?"
"I, the most noble and mighty $AI3, demand the right of passage for my  $CIVADJ5 troops through the lands of $CIVNAME1.  In turn I will ensure that our borders are opened to your $CIVADJ2 bands, but – mark my words – we will be watching them closely for foul deeds."

"It is good that the valorous troops of $CIVNAME1 and $CIVNAME7 fight shoulder to shoulder against evil $CIVNAME3. By all reports, things are going well. Is there some assistance you now require, $PLAYER0?" 
"Hail noble $PLAYER0, leader of the mighty nation of $CIVNAME1. How can I be of assistance?”
"Ah, $PLAYER0. Wonderful to see you again! Come, let us stroll through my gardens and discuss plans for our next campaign against loathsome $CIVNAME3, our common enemy.”
"Ah, $PLAYER0, my brave ally and noble leader of $CIVNAME1. Tell me the name of the next $CIVADJ4 city that the just hand of wrath should visit.”
“How goes the war against $CIVNAME3, $PLAYER0?”
“It is good that you have come to talk with me, $PLAYER0.  Until the demise of our mutual enemy, $CIVNAME3, we will have much to discuss.”
“Stamping out the armies of $CIVNAME3 is much like rooting out cockroaches from the kitchen, but together we will manage it.”
"Welcome, $PLAYER0, brother in arms against the wretched $CIVADJ4 people. Share tales of your glorious victories with us and then, perhaps, I might honor a humble request. But make it a good tale, lest my mind grows weary of it, and then, pray that the earth does not shake in my wake."
"Come, sit down in my tambo, and let us share in stories of our gallant adventures against the vile dogs of $CIVNAME3."
"Ah, $PLAYER0, Earth Shaker $AI6 of the $CIVNAME7 greets you. Our campaign against $CIVNAME3 continues. Perhaps if the troops of $CIVNAME1 were more plentiful it would be over. Now, just what is it you want? And make it snappy; the wind blows cold across the Andes and the warm hearth of my tambo calls."
"Greetings, $PLAYER0!  Is there some way that the mighty $CIVADJ8 nation can assist you in our common struggle against the evil $CIVADJ4 people?"
"Ah, $PLAYER0, my brother and close ally.  In what way can the $CIVADJ8 people assist the $CIVADJ2 people in our common struggle against the outlaw peoples of $CIVNAME3?"
"$PLAYER0, so good to see you again!  We appreciate your assistance in our rightful struggle against evil $CIVNAME3.  Tell me, in what way may I be of assistance?"

"$PLAYER0, my future slave. Enjoying your last days of freedom?"
"$PLAYER0, I've truly enjoyed leveling your culture. Have you come to beg for mercy?"
"Well, my spies have reported your assassination prematurely it seems. Speak before I fulfill that prophecy myself!"
"You unwisely have contested the $CIVADJ6 people. Tell me you have learned your lesson."
"It seems your nation teeters on the brink of oblivion. Have you come to beg for $AI4 forgiveness?"
"Your blood decorates our weapons. Speak quickly or it shall decorate my palace." 
"I should kill you where you stand, but I am counseled against it. It's your lucky day."
"You dare come into the presence of $AI4? You're either very stupid or very brave." 
"Say what you've come to say, $PLAYER0. Then run. Run for your life."
"What is it you wish to discuss, $PLAYER0?"

"What is that horrid odor? Ah, I see, we have a visitor. Are you here regarding our little squabble?"
"Ah, there you are $PLAYER0! Your smell precedes you. Are you here to surrender?"
"The mere sight of you offends me, $PLAYER0. I do hope you have something important to say."
"Ah, my foe! Have you come here to discuss peace?"
"Lo! Do I see my enemy before me? Surely there must be something important to discuss?"

"You have come to surrender I presume? Otherwise, I do not wish to hear it."
"Why is it you contact me, $PLAYER0? Do you seek peace."
"To know HIM is to know peace, $PLAYER0. Do you seek HIM?"

"Do you have the resolution to this conflict in hand? If not, be gone with you!"
"You have great courage coming before me like this, $PLAYER0, while our people are at war. What do you want to discuss?"
"Mere words are unlikely to avert your doom, $PLAYER0!"

"This is highly unusual, $PLAYER0. I will entertain you eccentricities for now."
"Do not anger me, $PLAYER0, or you may never return to your people."
"I have no patience for idle chatter, $PLAYER0. If this is not regarding peace, I do not want to hear it."
"I will NEVER be taken alive, $PLAYER0! Is this regarding your own surrender?"
"You have walked in here upright to speak with me, $PLAYER0. Whether you leave, lying on your back and bleeding, depends on what you have to say."
"Mere words are unlikely to avert your doom, $PLAYER0! Why are you here?"
"This war is tearing us apart...why do we fight so? Have you come to discuss terms of peace?"
"I do not understand why my enemy would seek an audience with me, but I will humor you...for now."
"$PLAYER0!? My enemy visits me? For what reason?"
"I was advised against taking this meeting $PLAYER0. You are still my foe, but I will humor your request for an audience just this once."
"This is very odd $PLAYER0. You are aware that we are at war with each other? You seek peace perhaps?"
"$PLAYER0! You are my sworn enemy, why are you contacting me? I do hope that this is in regards to some form of peace."
"I have little patience for your prattle $PLAYER0, make it quick."
"What is the reason of this visit, $PLAYER0. You do understand that we are still enemies, or has it slipped your addled mind?"
"Why are you here? Make this quick so that I may continue thrashing your sorry hide."
"$PLAYER0, have you wizened up and come to talk terms with me?"
"If you have come offering terms, $PLAYER0, I might humor you. Otherwise you should not dare to waste the time of $AI4."
"You are brave indeed, $PLAYER0, to set foot in my halls after wetting your sword with the blood of so many of my troops! Be quick, and tell me what it is that you desire."
"A wiser leader would have stayed away, $PLAYER0, while our troops wage deadly war. Humor me with your rude request, then be gone."
"Do the pitiful citizens of $CIVNAME1 grow tired of the bloodletting they endure at the expense of your pride? Perhaps you have wizened up and have come to seek terms..."
"If you have come to talk reason, so be it. If not, $PLAYER0, you will soon wish you did not waste my time."
"Ah, come to grovel before the great $AI4! This had BETTER be good or you will pay dearly for it. Speak!"
"Oh, it is you, wretched leader of the vile $CIVNOUN3. I have often wondered what a talking worm actually sounds like. Speak, now, and humor the great $PLAYER0!" 
"If you come seeking terms, foolish $PLAYER0, you have probably come in vain. Humor me - quickly! - and then rid my palace of your filthy carcass."
"Greetings, $PLAYER0. The nation of $CIVNAME5 is mighty, but would prefer peace rather than continue to wage war with the people of $CIVNAME5. What is it that you wish to propose?"
"I acknowledge your request to meet, $PLAYER0. But do NOT waste my time, as my troops need my wise council in their just struggle against your godless thugs."
"Welcome. Does $PLAYER0, also, think that it is about time that we sat down and diplomatically ended this frightful conflict between our two peoples?"
"The blades of $CIVNAME5 are just in their continued retribution against your outlaw nation, $PLAYER0. On what matter do you foolishly choose to waste my time?"
"If you have come to seek terms, $PLAYER0, they had better be generous, as I have already more than had my fill of your vile mutterings."
"I, the wise $AI4 of mighty $CIVNAME5, have mercifully decided to grant you an audience. But first, be it known that $CIVNAME5 does not fear war with your miserable civilization. Now - speak your mind!"
"Be prepared to surrender much of what is dear to you, $PLAYER0, if you have come to seek terms with mighty $CIVNAME6 on this day."
"The gallant armies of $CIVNAME5 drive your pitiful brigands before them, $PLAYER0. Do you now dare to present yourself before me seeking terms of peace?" 
"Well, well, $PLAYER0, it appears that some sense has finally crept into your thick skull. Do you come now seeking terms with which to end this senseless massacre of your people?"
"$CIVNAME5 agrees to give audience to her foe. As a peace-loving nation we would prefer to end this senseless conflict. Have you come to talk terms?"
"It is not the desire of $CIVNAME5 to continue this bloody war, $PLAYER0. Shall we sit down and discuss terms?"
"You will find that your trip has been wasted, $PLAYER0, if you have come to threaten my people with more of your doom. If your reasons are instead more benign I will hear you out."
"If you have come to talk peace, $PLAYER0, you had better do it quickly, as I have many important matters to attend."
"Many $CIVADJ2 soldiers have died under the blade of $CIVNAME5, $PLAYER0, and many more will soon - or have you come to your senses and wish to talk of peace?"
"What do you wish to discuss, $PLAYER0? I sincerely hope that this will not be a waste of my good time."
"Your stubborn people have suffered many bloody defeats under the keen blade of $CIVNAME5, $PLAYER0. If you have come to discuss terms of surrender then perhaps you are not as stupid as I thought."
"If you have come to beg for mercy, $PLAYER0, your bargaining hand had better be strong, as your armies are weak."
"Many $CIVADJ2 soldiers have died under the swift blade of $CIVNAME5, $PLAYER0, and many more will soon - or have you come to beg for mercy?"
“I stoop low to parley with you, $PLAYER0, my avowed foe. Although $CIVNAME1 is mighty, it shall not conquer us. WHY are you here wasting my time?”
“Why does your acrid stench pervade my halls, $PLAYER0?”
“The soldiers of $CIVNAME1 are good fighters, $PLAYER0, and ruthless - but they will NEVER be good enough to conquer proud $CIVNAME5. Have you at last realized this and come to offer me fair terms?”
“For what reason do you despoil my halls, $PLAYER0? Speak quick and be on your way!”
“$CIVNOUN3 are skilled and ruthless fighters, $PLAYER0 - but they will NEVER be good enough to conquer mighty $CIVNAME5. Have you at last come to grips with this reality, and wish to talk terms?”
“Like your pathetic troops, you stray far from the battlefield, $PLAYER0. What are you doing here? Come to grovel?”
“If you have come seeking peace, $PLAYER0, be prepared to surrender much of what was once yours. $CIVNAME5 does not care for cowards nor their wants.”
“Just what brings you, my hated foe, before me today? If you seek to end the slaughter of your people, $PLAYER0, it will cost you dearly.” 
“$PLAYER0, what a surprise! I was just talking with my war minister about what a pushover your armies are. Have you come to beg for mercy?”
“Have you come here to mock me, $PLAYER0, or is there actually something important you wish to discuss. Be brief; I have no time to waste!”
“If you have come to ask for my surrender, $PLAYER0, you have wasted your precious time. $CIVNAME5 never caves in to aggression!”
“I hope that your unjust war against the people of $CIVNAME5 gives you peptic ulcers, $PLAYER0. What drivel is it that you wish me to hear today?”
“If you continue to wage war on $CIVNAME5, $PLAYER0, then the sad fate of $CIVNAME1 is sealed.”
“Is there something you wish to discuss, $PLAYER0? I would prefer to settle this on the field of battle!"
“So, is it true that the ‘great and powerful’ $PLAYER0 has come to discuss terms?”
“Have you come to dishonor yourself, $PLAYER0?”
“The only matter that I care to discuss with you is the surrender of $CIVNAME1.” 
“I will listen to your pleas for mercy - but only so long as they amuse me. Now - speak!”
“The resilience of your armies surprises me, $PLAYER0, but do not count yourself victorious quite yet.”
“Your legions are worthy opponents for the mighty $CIVADJ5 armies, $PLAYER0, but $CIVNAME5 will yet prevail.”
“$CIVADJ6 poets and scribes have written epic stories of the struggle between $CIVNAME5 and $CIVNAME1, and no doubt there will be more to come.”
“$CIVNAME5 greets the leader of its enemies.  The rules of war guarantee your safe departure, but we cannot say the same for your soldiers.”
“I thought the time for talk had passed, $PLAYER0.  Your obstinacy has led to many $CIVADJ2 deaths – do you now wish to bow to the reality of your situation?”
“Have you come to talk terms, $PLAYER0?  That would surprise me, since barbarians such as yourself so often prefer mindless bloodshed to the voice of reason.”
“Now that you have seen the naked might of $CIVNAME5 unleashed against your helpless armies, perhaps you have come to ask mercy?”
“$CIVNAME5 does not usually treat with barbarians – especially not those who, like $CIVNAME1, are on the verge of utter defeat.”
“I cannot fathom the reasons for your coming here, $PLAYER0.  Your cities burn, your soldiers desert and die, and your fields lie barren.  How could it be in the best interests of the $CIVADJ2 people to remain under your rule, rather than the benevolent protection of $CIVNAME5?”
“$PLAYER0, have you become intelligent and wish to talk terms with me?”
“If you have come offering terms, $PLAYER0, I might humor you.  Otherwise you should not dare to waste the time of the Earth shaker $AI4.”
“You are brave indeed, $PLAYER0, to set foot in my halls after wetting your blade with the blood of so many of my troops!  Be quick, and tell me what it is that you desire.”
“A wiser leader would have stayed away, $PLAYER0, while our troops wage deadly war. Humor me with your rude request, then let the wind of the Andes sweep you out of my valleys.”
“Do the pitiful citizens of $CIVNAME1 grow tired of the pummeling they endure at the expense of your pride?  Perhaps you have grown an intellect and have come to seek terms...”
“If you have come to talk reason, give it a try.  If not, $PLAYER0, you will soon wish you had not wasted my time. I am the mighty Earth Shaker; I am more important than you.”
“Ah, come to grovel before the great Earth Shaker $AI4!  This had BETTER be good or you will pay dearly for it. Speak, if for no other reason but to prove that you can!”
“Oh, it is you, wretched leader of the vile $CIVNOUN3.  I have often wondered what a talking worm actually sounds like.  Speak, now, and humor the great $PLAYER0!” 
“If you come seeking terms, unimportant $PLAYER0, you have probably come in vain.  Humor me – quickly! – then rid my tambo of your filthy flesh.”
“Greetings, $PLAYER0.  The nation of the $CIVNAME5 is mighty, but would prefer peace with the people of $CIVNAME5.  What is it that you wish from me?”
“I acknowledge your request to meet, $PLAYER0.  But do NOT waste my time, as my troops need my wise council in their just struggle against your godless thugs.”
“Welcome.  Does $PLAYER0 think it is about time that we draw blood from our skins and discuss the end to this frightful conflict between our two peoples?”
“The warriors of the $CIVNAME5 are just in their continued retribution against your outlaw nation, $PLAYER0.  On what matter do you choose to waste my time?”
“If you have come to seek terms, $PLAYER0, they had better be generous. I have little time for fruitless offerings.”
“I, the wise and ethereal $AI4 of the $CIVNAME5, have mercifully decided to grant you an audience.  But first, let it be known that $CIVNAME5 does not fear war with your meek state.  Now – speak your mind or close it forever!”
“Be prepared to surrender much of what is dear to you, $PLAYER0, if you have come to seek terms with the righteous $CIVNAME6 on this day.”
“My armies drive your pitiful legions before them, $PLAYER0.  Do you now present yourself before me seeking terms of peace? Surely your are a ghost and this is a dream.” 
“My oh Mayan! $PLAYER0 appears in my palace. It seems that some sense has finally crept into your thick skull.  Do you come now seeking terms with which to end this senseless massacre of your people, or would you like to visit my slave pit?”

"Very well. We will give you what you request because of our friendship. But we are dismayed by your sudden greed."
"We will give you $GET3 as you request. But we do this not out of fear of you and your minions, but out of a love of peace."
"We will grant you the pay-off you request, for now, but beware. What goes around comes around..."
"Very well. We are paying dearly for our friendship with $CIVNAME1, I see. That concerns me."
"We will give you $GET3 as you request. I suggest that you do not take this as a sign of weakness, $PLAYER0. You do so at your peril."
"It appears that we do not have much choice but to agree to your extortionate demands. For now!"
"Oh very well. You are a needy friend, $PLAYER0. It is not a very pleasant trait."
"All right. We will give you what you ask. However, do not forget this when WE come to you for a request..."
"You are a bully, $PLAYER0. We will do as you wish - for now."
"I think we can agree to that. It is the price of friendship with your greedy culture, I suppose."
"This is no way to win allies, $PLAYER0. In the future you may regret that you have used $CIVNAME5 so shabbily."
"Your demand is extortionate - but it appears that we must give you what you want. Remember, though: even free 'gifts' may come with a price..."
"I guess that we owe you that much, 'friend' $PLAYER0. But our friendship does have limits, and you travel very close to them now."
"Oh all right. You are lucky that I am such a generous man, or our armies would be marching on your cities this instant!"
"$CIVNAME5 agrees to give you $GET3 as you have demanded. Take care that you do not push us too far!"
"Why of course, dear $PLAYER0! We are honored to give you this paltry gift. Very honored. Certainly. Think nothing of it."
"$CIVNAME5 agrees to your request, $PLAYER0. But I will tell you that we don't like it much. I hope that $GET3 is worth the risk of our friendship..."
"We recognize extortion when we see it - and we realize that there are some times when we must surrender to it. Just don't push us too far, $PLAYER0."
"$CIVNAME5 agrees to your request. But you should take care: this has a certain extortionate air to it, and it is no way to treat your friends. If you wish to keep them."
"Agreed. The pitcher may go to the well one time too many, $PLAYER0. Take care."
"You have us at a momentary disadvantage, and I must concede to your demand. This state of affairs will not last forever, though!"
"We are always happy to share our bounty with our friends and allies!"
"Very well. But be warned: the $CIVADJ6 people have very long memories."
"You know, I would be all over you like ugly on a hog, but it's an election year. So I must agree to your outrageous demands."
"Anything to keep a friend happy, of course!"
"If we must, we must. But the $CIVADJ6 people are not happy, $PLAYER0. Take care that you do not offend us once too often!"
"You are an evil person, $PLAYER0. But it appears that we have no choice but to agree to your demands."
"Certainly, $PLAYER0. It is better to give than to receive..."
"Very well. We agree to your request in the name of world peace."
"Very well. Extortion is a sin, $PLAYER0. Are the $CIVADJ2 people aware of your criminal activities, I wonder?"
"$CIVNAME5 is always happy to assist its good friend, $CIVNAME1!"
"No problemo. I hope that you'll remember this when we come to you for a favor..."
"All right. I will agree to your extortionate demands for the sake of world peace."
"It is said that when you give a friend a gift, it returns to you tenfold. We agree to your request."
"You have $CIVNAME5 at a temporary disadvantage, and you seek to profit from her discomfort. I have no choice but to agree, I suppose, but do not expect this unfortunate state of affairs to continue forever..."
"I will give you $GET3 as you demand. But you WILL pay a price for it, I assure you."
"The $CIVADJ7 are always eager to help their friends! But do not ask too often, if you know what's wise..."
"For the sake of world peace - and NOT because we fear you - we will give you what you ask. Got it?"
"I comply with your outrageous demands - but only to lull you into a false sense of superiority, to make your inevitable destruction all the sweeter!"
"I am concerned that you take advantage of us, $PLAYER0. But I will agree, for now."
"Very well. It is cheaper to agree to your demands than it would be to go to war. Now leave me before I change my mind."
"You are a thief and a bully! Someday you will pay for your crimes. Unfortunately, not today."
"You test the friendship of the $CIVADJ7, eh? You will not find us lacking."
"We will agree to your demands for the moment. But do not press us too far!"
"Very well. We choose not to go to war with you now, but that soon may change."
"Certainly. You will not find $CIVNAME5 ungrateful to her friends, $PLAYER0."
"We will comply with your request, $PLAYER0. You would be wise not to press us too far, however. We are a dangerous foe!"
"We have no choice but to agree to your demand. We will give you $GET3. And I hope you choke on it!"
"The $CIVADJ7 shall take pity on you and deliver what you request. Just don't be confused about who is controlling this situation, $PLAYER0."
"Perhaps one day you shall reciprocate $CIVADJ6 generosity. To that end we shall provide you with what you request." 
"We would rather deliver our blades into your backs, but the situation dictates otherwise. Take your plunder and be gone from my sight!"
"Very well...$GET3 is yours."
"$PLAYER0, your demands are outrageous, but we will humor you for now."
"Fine, but your abuse will not be tolerated in the future, $PLAYER0. What comes around goes around."
"Yes, fine, you may have $GET3, and now you must go! No guest shall stay in one place forever. Love will be lost if you sit too long at a friends fire, $PLAYER0."
"Fine, but remember: Be your friend's true friend, $PLAYER0. Return gift for gift, and repay betrayal with treachery."
"Fine, you may have $GET3. Be warned: A greedy man, if he be not mindful, will eat to his own life's hurt!"
"Yes, we will provide you with $GET3, but I not understand why you could not simply have asked for it in a more civil manner."
"We will yield to your avarice and provide you with $GET3, but this is no way to win our friendship, $PLAYER0."
"Very well...you may have $GET3, but I suggest that you watch your back from now on or you may very well find a knife in it."
"Yes. There are finer fish in the sea than have ever been caught, $PLAYER0. We will give you $GET3."
"Hah! You threaten well, $PLAYER0, but will you have what it takes to back it up when it really counts? You can have $GET3."
"You, sir, are an imbecile! We will grant you your request, if only to avoid a pointless dispute."
"We will grant you this outrageous request, $PLAYER0. I am certain that you will provide us with the same courtesy later. One way or another."
"It appears that we do not have much choice but to agree to your extortionate demands. For now!"
"You are an evil person, $PLAYER0. But it appears that we have no choice but to agree to your demands."
"Yes, I will share my prize, $GET3, with you; but I insist that the favor will be returned later."
"You are either very daring or very foolish to tempt my anger, $PLAYER0. In either case: I will submit $GET3, knowing that you will never comprehend its full potential."
"How dare you! How dare you take advantage of our weakened state! I will not forget this, $PLAYER0."
"We will grant you this request of yours, but your avarice will be your undoing."
"Very well, we will yield to your extortion for now. We will provide you with $GET3, just know that we only do this to maintain the peace."
"Does your greed know no bounds? I will provide you with $GET3, but I won't forget this."
"Very well, $PLAYER0, we shall grant your demands - but your sudden greediness troubles me and puts our friendship to a test."
"Advisors council me otherwise, $PLAYER0, but I - the mighty $AI4 of $CIVNAME5 - have decided to grant your request." 
"I would rather deliver my first born child to the underworld than these goods to you. However, in my infinite wisdom I have decided to grant your greedy request. But I warn you: do not try my patience!"
"Agreed, $PLAYER0, we will grant your request - this time. But surely you realize that this puts a strain on our friendly relations?"
"Your request for $GET3 has been granted." 
"It seems that your greed is as expansive as your mind is shallow, $PLAYER0. However, for the sake of continued peace I have decided grant your request for $GET3."
"If this demand is more important to you than our friendship, $PLAYER0, than you shall have it - but you will not have both!"
"We agree to grant you the $GET3 that you demand, $PLAYER0, but only for the love of peace." 
"Does it not pain you, $PLAYER0, to make such demands on $CIVNAME5? I warn you: do not push us too far!"
“$PLAYER0, it pains me to hear you demand this of me. Of course, I will grant what you desire, but it seems that I value our continued friendship more than you.” 
“Oh, alright - I will see to it that you get what you want, $PLAYER0. But I am quite perturbed by your sudden greediness.”
“Your demand is nothing short of extortion, $PLAYER0. But, I am a generous man and will grant what you desire - THIS time.”
“Certainly, $PLAYER0. Whatever you desire! Perhaps you would also like some tulips?”
“Although it is distasteful, I have decided to honor your request, $PLAYER0. I hope that $GET3 is worth the price of our friendship.” 
“This demand for $GET3 is nothing short of extortion, $PLAYER0! Unfortunately, I am in no position to refuse. But - mark my words! - there WILL come a day of reckoning!”
“Very well, but know that $CIVNAME5 does not treat such high-handed demands lightly.”
“I see fit to accede to your demand, this time.  Go quickly, before I change my mind.”
“No doubt it pleases you to demand the fruits of civilization from a peaceful nation such as $CIVNAME5.  Although you have the upper hand now, $PLAYER0, rest assured that the forces of order and culture will once again prevail.”
“Very well, $PLAYER0, I will grant your demands – but your sudden greediness troubles me and puts our friendship to a test.”

"Sorry, friend, but my mother didn't raise no fools. Increase your offer a little or find someone a bit more gullible."
"Don't try to out-horse-trade $CIVNAME4, $PLAYER0. Can't be done. Come up with a bit more and we've got a deal!"
"Surely you don't expect me to take this miserable deal to the $CIVADJ5 people? They would laugh me out of office! You must increase your offer!"
"Don't waste my time with nonsense. Give me an offer I can accept!"
"I think we are very close to a deal. Can you provide a little more?"
"Offer a little more, $PLAYER0, and we're in business."
"You bargain well, $PLAYER0. Increase your offer only slightly and we will trade."

"Do you take me for a fool? I demand that you increase your offer until it is fair!"
"$CIVNAME4 rejects your unfair offer. Will you not increase it for both our countries' sakes?"
"Offer a little more, $PLAYER0, and we're in business."

"That offer is unacceptable to $CIVNAME4. Improve it, please."
"This unfair offer is an insult to $CIVNAME4! Improve it."
"We spit upon this unfair offer. You must improve it!"
"I think we are very close to a deal. Can you provide a little more?"
"Surely you see that this deal is unfair to peaceful $CIVNAME4. Can you not improve it?"
"Come now: if the $CIVADJ5 and $CIVADJ2 people are to live in peace, then trades must be fair and equal. Add a trifle to your offer and we will be happy."
"I think we are very close, but you must come up with a little more."
"Is it your intent to provoke us? I urge you to increase your offer until it is fair!"
"Do not trifle with us, $PLAYER0! Will you not improve your offer and deal with us honorably?"
"I think we are very close to a deal. Can you provide a little more?"
"I think we are very close, but you must come up with a little more."
"I dislike quibbling. Please improve your offer so that we can close this deal and get on with world domination."
"This offer is not acceptable. Bargain fairly with us and we will have a deal."
"Do you take us for simpletons? $CIVNAME4 rejects your unfair offer! Will you not improve it?"

"Highway robbery! If $CIVNAME4 and $CIVNAME1 are to do business, you must increase your offer at least slightly."
"I think we are very close to a deal. Can you provide a little more?"

"A little more couldn't hurt."
"I'm certain you could offer a bit more, $PLAYER0"
"Be a little more giving, and I am sure we would happily accept."

"Surely, just a little more would not hurt?"
"That would seem reasonable if you offered just a little something extra."
"Offer a little more, $PLAYER0, and we will consider it done."

"Surely you forgot to include something else in this deal?"
"I think we are very close to a deal. Can you provide a little more?"
"I feel that if you offered just a bit more that this would be acceptable."

"This unfair offer is an insult to $CIVNAME4! Improve it."
"Unacceptable! I demand that you make a reasonable offer!"
"We are very close to striking a deal, $PLAYER0, my friend. Perhaps the $CIVADJ2 people can be just a BIT more generous."
"If you can only be just a bit more generous, $PLAYER0, I think we will have a deal we can both live with."
"We are almost there, but for me to agree to this you must offer up a bit more."
"We are indeed close to a deal, but you must first increase your offer."
"It would be an insult to accept this offer. Be reasonable or be gone!"
"Do not anger me further, $PLAYER0. Up the ante or else..."
"I am happy to see that we are close to agreeing, $PLAYER0. Be only a bit more generous and the deal will be done."
"Sweeten up your offer slightly, $PLAYER0, and we shall then be able to have our ministers take care of the minor details."
"It is obvious that we are very close to an agreement. A bit more generosity on your part will seal it."
"$PLAYER0, surely you can spare a bit more? We are so close to agreeing..."
"It is senseless to try to bargain with a thief! Sweeten up your offer a bit, $PLAYER0, or I will depart in anger."
"Tell me, $PLAYER0 - why do the $CIVADJ2 people tolerate a thief as their leader? Sweeten the deal a bit and perhaps this will not end up being a total waste of my time."
"Not yet, $PLAYER0 - but almost, my friend. If you could find it in your heart to be just a bit more generous..."
"Throw in just a little more, $PLAYER0, my friend, and I think we will come to an agreement."
"We are so very close to an agreement, $PLAYER0. Surely you can spare just a bit more, yes?"
"Very close - very, but not quite. Offer a bit more and we can wrap this up."
"SO close. If you can offer only a bit more, $PLAYER0, I believe we will have an agreement."
"I do not anger easily, $PLAYER0, but this is becoming a chore. Be a bit more generous - or be on your way."
“Quite underhanded to try to skimp on a friend, don’t you think, $PLAYER0? You’ll need to sweeten the pot a little if you want your offer to be acceptable
“Being a friend, surely you can offer a little more?”
“Surely you can offer a little more, $PLAYER0?”
“Not yet. You will need to dig a little deeper if you want me to approve this exchange.”
“Do NOT try to cheat me, $PLAYER0! You’ll need to give a little more if you want your offer to be acceptable.”
“It is becoming apparent that $CIVNAME1 should also be known for its miserliness. If you cannot come up with a little more, $PLAYER0, then you cannot expect me to find this agreeable.”
“I’ll need a little bit more, my friend, before I can be happy with this deal. What else can you spare, $PLAYER0?”
“We are almost there, $PLAYER0. Perhaps just a smidgen more?”
“Surely $CIVNAME1 can be just a wee bit more generous?”
“Almost. Just another small pinch of your generosity and we’ll can put a wrap on this.”
“You begin to anger me, $PLAYER0, I know that you can spare just a wee bit more.”
“Loosen your purse-string just a bit more, $PLAYER0, and let’s end this bickering.”
“That offer tempts me sorely, but I fear I must decline.”
“Alas, I cannot accept.  I hope you will join me nonetheless for the afternoon chariot races.”
“I would rest much easier in my grand palace if you were to sweeten the deal a bit more, $PLAYER0.”
“No, but we’re nearly there.”
“I am ashamed to say that I am tempted by your craven haggling, $PLAYER0.  But not quite tempted enough to give in.”
“I expected any offer from a barbarian such as yourself to be simply outrageous, but this offer is perhaps less so.  Perhaps if you threw in something more as a consolation for the bother you have caused me, I might be tempted to give way.”
“We are very close to striking a deal, $PLAYER0, my friend.  Perhaps the $CIVADJ2 people can be just a BIT more generous; after all you are in the presence of royalty.”
“If you can be just a bit more generous, $PLAYER0, I think we will have a deal we can both live with.”
“We are almost there, but for me to agree to this you must offer up a bit more.”
“We are close to a deal, $PLAYER0, but you must first increase your offer. I cannot look at my own reflection in the waters of Lake Titicaca unless you offer more. The shame would be too great.”
“It would be an insult to accept this offer.  Be reasonable or leave my mountains!”
“Do not anger me further, $PLAYER0.  Up the ante or else you shall know why they call me the Earth Shaker.”
“I’m delighted that we are close to a deal, $PLAYER0.  But a bit more generosity will suit you better.”
“Sweeten the tea slightly, $PLAYER0, and then our priests can take care of the details.”
“It is obvious that we are very close to an agreement.  A bit more generosity on your part, and the jaguar will rest in his cage.”
“$PLAYER0, surely you can spare a bit more? We are so close to agreeing...”
“It is senseless to try to bargain with a thief!  Sweeten your offer, $PLAYER0, or the jaguar will leap from his cage.”
“Tell me, $PLAYER0 – why do the $CIVADJ2 people tolerate a thief as their leader?  Sweeten the deal a bit and perhaps our time will have been well spent.”

"I have no time for this. The deal you offer is unacceptable in the extreme."

"*PTUI!* I spit on your so-called 'offer'!"
"You do not treat your friends very fairly, $PLAYER0. This troubles me."
"I cannot agree to such a one-sided arrangement - not even to help a friend."

"$CIVNAME4 must decline this offer, $PLAYER0, with regret. It is unfair."
"My friend, why do you not bargain fairly with us? How have we displeased you?"
"Your offer is completely unacceptable."
"$CIVNAME4 cannot possibly accept this terrible offer!"
"WHAT? Do you mock $CIVNAME4? Be careful, $PLAYER0: I'm on the edge here!"
"I would eat dung before accepting such a contemptible offer!"
"This offer appears to be a bit one-sided, $PLAYER0. Well, A LOT one-sided, actually. We decline, with thanks."
"Hmmm. With friends like you, who needs enemies? I must reject your offer."
"Is this a joke? If so, I'm sorry but I don't find it at all funny."
"This offer smells like a barrel full of dead fish in July. I refuse to have anything to do with it."
"$PLAYER0, you persist in underestimating me. You may regret that some day - others have. I decline your contemptible offer."
"This offer is an insult to the people I have the honor to represent. Now go away before I forget myself and do something rural and picturesque."
"Friendship has its limits, $PLAYER0. This offer exceeds them."
"I cannot accept this offer, $PLAYER0. It appears unfair to $CIVNAME4 on the face of it."
"This offer is rejected. With disdain."
"That is your offer, eh? Are you a fool or a thief, I wonder?"
"What? You have the gall to offer $CIVNAME4 THIS?!? No! No! No! A thousand times, NO! Somebody hold me back before I gut this jackal!"
"Inconceivable! You must think we're idiots!"
"$CIVNAME4 must reject your offer, $PLAYER0. It is totally unfair to her."
"I cannot accept these terms, even to please you. I am sorry."
"$PLAYER0, your offer is a grave insult to $CIVNAME4."
"This is a completely unfair offer, and $CIVNAME4 will have nothing to do with it."
"WHAT? Certainly not! Your offer is absurd on the face of it!"
"I beg your pardon? Is THIS your idea of a fair trade? You must be insane!"
"I am shocked that you would abuse our friendship by offering me such a terrible deal, $PLAYER0!"
"$CIVNAME4 must refuse this offer. It is completely unfair."

"I must decline your offer, my friend. It is awful."
"Your offer is terrible and I must reject it. But thanks for asking!"
"Don't insult me with such drivel!"
"Forget it. I'm not feeling that generous today."
"This offer is a grave insult to the $CIVADJ6!"
"What? You DARE to offer this 'deal' to $AI3, direct descendant of the gods?! You will suffer for this, I promise you!"
"Your offer is tempting, but entirely unfair to the $CIVADJ5 people. I decline, with thanks."
"Is this how you treat your friends, $PLAYER0? I am very disappointed in you."
"Perhaps you'd like my eldest son as well?"
"Not a chance."
"Do you mock Mighty $AI3 with this nonsense?"
"Do you take me for a simpleton? I have emptied entire continents for less provocation!"

"You must be kidding! Do you think I'm a fool?"

"Hah! I expect that you'd like me to throw in Manhattan Island as well!"
"You negotiate with forked tongue. That deal is contemptible."
"You waste all of our time with such nonsense."
"I believe that this offer is completely unfair to $CIVNAME4, so I must regretfully decline."
"Were I a blind old woman who could not recognize her own grand children, I would still find such an offer ridiculous!"
"Double or triple the value of your offer and perhaps you'll walk out of here alive!"
"That is your offer, eh? Are you a fool or a thief, I wonder?"
"You can not be serious! This deal is ludicrous!"
"I do want to trade with you, $PLAYER0, but you are making it difficult."
"We will not accept any such proposal."
"That deal is an insult to my intelligence, $PLAYER0."
"Why do you insist on wasting my time?"
"Is this some sort of game to you, $PLAYER0?"
"Honestly, $PLAYER0! Why do you think you can bamboozle me?"
"You are too frugal, $PLAYER0. I would never accept that."
"Let's just pretend that you didn't just try to swindle me."
"Are you trying to swindle me?"
"Don't waste any more of my time!"
"You will not beguile me like some flirty wench!"
"Arrrghh!"
"Despite our friendship, I can not agree to this deal, $PLAYER0."
"How are you able to look at me with a straight face while offering me this?"
"You can not be serious. I would not even offer this sham of a deal to my own enemies."
"Your bargaining skills leave a lot to be desired, $PLAYER0. Please leave me alone and only come back when you have something more to offer."
"You make a horrible salesman, $PLAYER0, surely there must be more that you can offer me."
"Unacceptable! Do not tell me that it is raining gold while you pee on me, $PLAYER0!"
"I'm sorry, there is no way I would ever accept this deal."
"I could never agree to this!"
"This deal is simply unbelievable...in a bad way."
"Regretfully, $CIVNAME4 must decline your offer, $PLAYER0."
"This offer is a sham!"
"Please, make another proposal when you are sober, $PLAYER0."
"I cannot agree to such a one-sided arrangement - not even to help a friend."
"I believe that this offer is completely unfair to $CIVNAME4, so I must regretfully decline."
"Forget it, $PLAYER0. Your offer is absurd."
"I beg your pardon? Is THIS your idea of a fair trade? You must be insane!"
"That is your offer, eh? Are you a fool or a thief, I wonder?"
"You can not be serious! This deal is ludicrous!"
"HAH! Ok, Ok... now put your 'real' proposal on the table. Your jokes bring a tear to my eye, $PLAYER0. I laugh so hard."
"Surely, you must have some idea of how unfair this deal is?"
"That deal is unacceptable."
"We will not accept any such proposal."
"Once again, you leave me hanging, $PLAYER0. I tire of this."

"You can not be serious! This deal is ludicrous!"
"It is a waste of both my time and yours to see such nonsense tabled in front of me. If you were not a friend, $PLAYER0, I would be insulted."
"It is abundantly clear to me that this offer is blatantly unfair to $CIVNAME4. Why does a friend attempt to humor me with such nonsense?"
"Even if I were a blind beggar pleading for handouts I could see that such a deal is unfair to the people of $CIVNAME4."
"That deal is totally unacceptable. Why do you waste my time with such drivel?"
"You call that an offer? It is nothing short of thievery! Would you care to know what we do to thieves in $CIVNAME4?"
"Surely you jest, $PLAYER0. That proposal is an affront to my good sensibilities!"
"If you were not a friend, $PLAYER0, I would have you bodily removed from my premises for tabling such a one-sided proposal. Have your good senses departed you? Come now - I know that you can do much better than that."
"$PLAYER0, it pains me so to see you present such an unrealistic offer to me, $AI3, your friend. Surely this is a mistake?"
"Were I a barbarian, $PLAYER0, I would remove you bodily from my premises for tabling such rubbish. Have your wits completely abandoned you?! You had better be willing to cough up more - MUCH more!"
"You are not much of a bargainer, $PLAYER0, if you think that deal is even remotely agreeable."
"You call THAT a deal?? A pen of hogs would smell like roses if put against it."
"It is an insult to my intelligence that you even table such a ridiculous proposal, $PLAYER0!"
"I am insulted that someone I call a friend could think I would agree to such a blatantly unfair deal."
"You have obviously been enjoying too much good pilsner, my friend, if you thought I could agree to such nonsense."
"Absolutely not, $PLAYER0."
"That deal is most unfair to $CIVNAME4. I could never accept it."
"You are a scoundrel, $PLAYER0, if you think for a minute that I could even consider such a one-sided deal."
"You are clearly wasting my time tabling such rubbish! Is the entire $CIVADJ2 civilization nothing but thieves?"
“$PLAYER0, my friend, are you ill? This so-called ‘deal’ you propose is quite unfair to $CIVNAME4. Perhaps I should find you a tonic?”
“My dear $PLAYER0, surely there has been a mistake. I could never agree to such a one-sided deal.”
“You are a rascal, $PLAYER0, to propose such a one-sided deal.”
“I find this totally unacceptable, $PLAYER0.”
“You are a cod-brained fool, $PLAYER0, to propose such a one-sided deal - and then to think it might actually be acceptable.”
“This is not a deal at ALL, $PLAYER0 - this is thievery, and YOU are the thief!”
“$PLAYER0, surely you realize that proposal is quite one-sided? If you were not a friend I would think you were trying to cheat me.”
“This I must decline, my dear $PLAYER0. It is quite unfair to $CIVNAME4.”
“This proposal of yours is unfair - oh, and unacceptable, too!”
“$CIVNAME4 could never agree to this, $PLAYER0.”
“Were I not mannered, $PLAYER0, I would spit on that proposal. As it is, I’ll just reject it out of hand instead.”
“You take me for a fool?!”
“What manner of evil spirit has possessed you, $PLAYER0, to think I would consider such an unfair offer?  Let me summon my priests immediately!”
“Surely you jest, $PLAYER0.”
“I suppose I could expect nothing better from the likes of you, $PLAYER0.  $CIVNAME5 is not a nation of fools, though.”
“Perhaps the barbarians you associate with are gullible enough to consider such short-sighted offers, $PLAYER0, but rest assured that the $CIVADJ6 are not.”
“I have heard enough.  In my presence you stand above your station, and now you insult me with that offer?”
“I would sooner accept an offer of the pox from a disease-ridden beggar than the one you have just made, $PLAYER0.”
“It is a waste of both my time and yours to see such nonsense placed before me.  If you were not a friend, $PLAYER0, I would be insulted. In fact, forget friendship. I am insulted!”
“It is abundantly clear to me that this offer is unfair to the $CIVNAME4.  Why does a friend attempt to scar me with such nonsense?”
“Even if I were a blind slave pleading for scraps I could see that such a deal is unfair to the $CIVNAME4. Are we not friends, $PLAYER0?”
“That deal is totally unacceptable.  Why do you waste my time with such drivel?”
“You call that an offer?  It is nothing short of thievery!  Would you care to know what we do to thieves in $CIVNAME4 land? Step outside and see the bodies spitted up on poles to know what I think of your offer.”
“Surely you jest, $PLAYER0.  That proposal is an affront to my good sensibilities!”
“Were you not a friend, $PLAYER0, I would have you thrown into my slave pit for offering such a one-sided deal.  Come now - I know that you can do better than that.”
“$PLAYER0, it pains me to see you present such an unrealistic offer to me, $AI3, your friend.  How have I insulted you?”
“Were I a barbarian, $PLAYER0, I throw you into my slave pit for offering such rubbish.  Have your wits completely abandoned you?!  You had better be willing to cough up more - MUCH more!”

"Rejected. What are you gonna do about it, huh? Go ahead, punk - make my day."
"It's not very nice to try to blackmail your friends, $PLAYER0. Not at all cricket."
"This is nothing less than extortion. $CIVNAME4 does not give in to extortion."
"How DARE you? Do you not realize whom you are speaking to? Go now: I am perilously close to violating your diplomatic immunity with extreme prejudice!"
"Your imitation of a human with a backbone amuses us! Now perform a dance for $AI3's nickels!"
"You should exhibit slightly greater sense of self preservation, $PLAYER0. You are in no position to demand anything."
"Wonderful! I've been waiting for a chance to split your skull. Continue with your demands and empower my wrath!"
"$PLAYER0, you threaten your friends?! Your behavior is highly unusual."

"Remember, $PLAYER0, even when you have lost all, keep your good name for if you lose that, you yourself become worthless."
"You snort and scratch for your own good, $PLAYER0. Your threats will be ignored."
"Swine! Your bluff has been called!"
"You would threaten me? Perhaps I have been wrong about you all along $PLAYER0."
"Take your empty threats elsewhere. While lesser leaders may have bowed down to you, I know you for the windbag you are."
"How crude! Be gone before I thrash you for your insolence!"
"If I did not know any better I would think that you had just threatened me, $PLAYER0."
"Take your threats elsewhere, $PLAYER0. We will not be shaken by your big words and frantic, meaningless chatter."

"You can not bully $AI3! I refuse to give in to your silly demands."
"Never! It is clear that greed inspires you now. What happened to the $PLAYER0 that we knew and loved?"
"Is this the manner in which you normally talk to a friend? It is not a wonder that you have so few of them left, dear $PLAYER0."
"If you think that you can coerce the $CIVADJ5 civilization with hollow words you are sorely mistaken."
"Your hollow threats are wasted upon me. Do not be surprised if the wrath of $CIVNAME4 soon lays waste to your pitiful lands."

"You are sorely mistaken, $PLAYER0, if you think that you can bully the mighty warrior-nation of $CIVNAME4 with such baseless threats."
"PTUI!! The land of $CIVNAME4 spits upon the vile threats of $CIVNAME1!"
"Forget it! If this is the way you deal with a friend, $PLAYER0, I do not wish to know how you treat your enemies."
"No! But I have some spoiled sausage here you could try..."
 "Perhaps you would like some sauerkraut to go with this big, fat 'NO'?!"
“That sounds a lot like extortion, $PLAYER0, and no one extorts $CIVNAME4 and gets away with it.”
“Bull! You make an unreasonable demand, and then demand a reasonable answer.”
“Fool! I would not even give you a box of rotten fish!”
“I find it had to believe that someone I once called ‘friend’ would try to bully me so.”
“Your bully tactics are not going to work on the $CIVADJ6, $PLAYER0.”
“No - and don’t dare threaten the $CIVADJ6 again or our armies will make short work of your sad civilization!”
“Your words wound me, $PLAYER0.  The brotherhood of civilized leaders depends on courtesy and respect, not crudeness and threats.”
“Take your empty threats elsewhere, $PLAYER0.  $CIVNAME4 does not bow to the likes of you.”
“Your prattling amuses me, $PLAYER0, but we will see how you bluster when the $CIVADJ5 people decide at last to put you in your proper place.”
“Is this the manner in which you normally talk to a friend?  It is not a wonder that you have so few of them left, dear $PLAYER0.”
“If you think that you can coerce the $CIVADJ5 civilization with hollow words you are sorely mistaken. My people are hearty and steadfast in their dedication to the glory of the empire, $PLAYER0. Do not insult them with empty tambos.”

“They will depart immediately.  Hopefully there will be no need for them to return. But my scouts will keep an ever-watchful eye upon your borders, $PLAYER0, and if they see the banners of war unfurl, then I will respond accordingly.”
“That is YOUR land?  Well, if you insist.  But be warned that the wrath of the $CIVNAME4 is growing. Do not anger us or they shall return.”
“Sorry to trouble you, pleasant $PLAYER0.  My warriors will depart very soon.”
“I shall honor your request, $PLAYER0.  But you should not let such a small band of $CIVADJ5 warriors trouble you so.  They are as harmless as the butterfly.”
“Yes, I will see that they quickly depart your soulless lands.  But the patience of the $CIVNAME4 grows thin with your intolerant ways. The jaguar rages in his cage.”
